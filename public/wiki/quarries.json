Now, the power of its grief and fury pours like invisible poison from the weeping face it hides inside its hulking body.\"Dragon King Expansion Rulebook, Showdown: Dragon King, pg. 6\n\nThe Dragon King's species is long dead.

The Dragon King appears in his humanoid form as The Tyrant, adopting a nearby settlement. The survivors develop their settlement around The Tyrant's throne.\n\nUnder the watchful gaze of the Tyrant, the survivors strive to grow powerful and become reborn as one of the People of the Stars. Under the Tyrant's guidance, the survivors push their bodies to unnatural limits or die trying. Those who are successful find their bodies mutating to provide them with a powerful boon, signifying their acceptance into the clan.\n\nEventually, The Tyrant reveals his true form to the settlement, demanding that they erect a tomb for him and place him in it once they have killed him. Once the tomb is constructed, the Dragon King descends upon the settlement in search of a glorious death at the hands of those who have ascended to become the new People of the Stars.\nStory Events.\nGlowing Crater\nShowdown: Dragon King\nMeltdown\nHunt Events.\nCultivated Crypt\nDoppel Den\nLava Flow\nLorekeeper\nMajestic Shadow\nOrnate Temple\nSettlement Ruins\nThespian Troupe\n\nStat Breakdown.\n\nAI Cards.\nSpecial.\nDragon King Data Card\nIrradiate\nSmolder\nStarward\nUnseen Agony\nBasic.\nGnash\nLordly Roar\nMolten Strike\n2x Nuclear Blast\nOne-Two Punch\nOverheat\nRough Smack\nTooth and Tail\nAdvanced.\nAshen Return\nCountdown\n2x Crisis Crater\nGlowing Fist\nHeated Strike\nMournful Swipe\nStuff of Nightmares\nLegendary.\nAtomic Conclusion\nDeath Descending\nRend Asunder\n\nHit Locations.\nBony Chest Sphincter\nEngulf in Light\nHeartface\n4x Microwave Heart\nSerpent Abdomen\nSerpent Chest\nSerpent Foot\nSerpent Horns\nSerpent Tail Vertebra\nSerpent Tail\nSerpent Talon\nSerpent Thigh\nSerpent Throat\nSerpent Wing Talon\n2x Serpent Wings (Reflex Reaction)\n2x Serpent Wings (Wound Reaction)\nThe King's Mouth\nTrap - Cosmic Uppercut\n\nResources.\n2x Cabled Vein\nDragon Iron\nHardened Ribs\n4x Horn Fragment\n3x Husk\n4x King's Claws\nKing's Tongue\n2x Radioactive Dung\n3x Veined Wing\n\nSee Also.\nTyrant\nPeople of the Stars\nDragon King Expansion\n\nReferences.",

There was a Shadow that was sad, it could only play in the small light of a lantern. The Shadow found a hole in the sky and decided to steal enough lanterns to fill it. It took many generations, and when it was done the shadow slept under its big light, dreaming dreams about how it would play. When it awoke, all of the light was gone! At the center of the hole in the sky, was a tiny shining entity, with a great big mouth. The shadow named the tiny thing the sun and they played forever.\"Kingdom Death: Monster online store - Sunstalker expansion description\n\n\"A rarely seen entity that swims through light. As they reach adulthood they become voracious, attempting to ingest a lifetime of food before they lay their young and take to the sky. There, from immense altitudes, they shine a radiant, warm light that slowly matures their spawn over countless human generations.\"Kingdom Death: Monster online store - Adult Sunstalker miniature description\n\nSunstalkers are rarely seen creatures that manipulate and swim through light, shifting the colors of the spectrum at their whim. As they reach adulthood they become voracious, attempting to ingest a lifetime of food before they lay their young and take to the sky. There, from immense altitudes, they shine a radiant, warm light that slowly matures their spawn over countless human generations. \n\nA tribe of humans began to worship a very ancient Sunstalker as the sun itself when it stepped down from the sky to rest on a mountain top. Countless generations and centuries have passed and a strange symbiotic relationship has emerged between human and monster. The human culture tends to the Sunstalkers young spawn, feeding it with a combination of food and ritual sacrifice. Only the fairest of maidens are selected for the horrifying honor of being a caretaker and not many survive the creatures period of infancy.\n\nIn an attempt to create a lasting relationship between the human and monster, the child of a mighty sunwarrior is umbilically attached to the young Sunstalker. This is a highly dangerous practice that occasionally results in a symbiotic link between man and monster. Sometimes the human child gains some of the creatures strange ability to manipulate light.\n\nAs the Sunstalker uses light to travel, a known technique to hunt these dangerous entities is to travel with a strongly dyed piece of fabric and monitor it closely for strange color shifts and de-saturation patterns. Ancient Sunstalkers will sleep for centuries at a time, floating high in the sky and pulse with vibrant rays of light as they slowly and deeply breath.Collection of design notes and concepts from the development of Kingdom Death: Monster\n\nStory Events.\nConquer Your Shadow\nEdged Tonometry\nPromise Under the Sun\nShowdown: Sunstalker\n\nHunt Events.\nBlack to Blue\nCrackling Sunstorm\nCuddling Skeletons\nEmpty Pool\nHeliophobia\nPerfect Meadow\nSalted Dream\nSolar Winds\n\nStat Breakdown.\n\nAI Cards.\nSpecial.\nBlack Blood\nLight & Shadow\nLiving Shadows\nMonochrome\nShade\nShadows of Darkness\nSolar Energy\nSun Dial\nBasic.\nBoiling Darkness\nCosmic Roar\nDazzling Beam\nPrism Dehydrate\nShadow Tentacles\nSunstare\nTentacle Whip\nVerdant Bubble\nVerdigris Bubble\nVermilion Bubble\nAdvanced.\nCosmic Heat\nPresence of the Sun\nRed Light, Green Light\nShimmering Atmosphere\nSunshark Bite\nViolet Bubble\nViscous UV Beam\nLegendary.\nOversaturation\nReflective Atmosphere\nShadow Dance\n\nHit Location Cards.\nBoiling Mirage Tentacle\nBrilliant Mouth\nBrilliant Sunshark Belly\nBrilliant Sunshark Chest\nBrilliant Tentacle\nCosmic Spiracle\nCosmic Stalk Nipple\nCosmic Tentacle\nEngulf in Light\nFertility Clasper\nInk Heart\nLight Bending\nPrismatic Gills\nPrismatic Handed Fin\nSunshark Molar\nSunshark Snout\nTrap - Vomit Kaleidoscope\n\nResources.\nBlack Lens\nBrain Root\nCycloid Scales\nFertility Tentacle\nHuge Sunteeth\nInner Shadow Skin\nPrismatic Gills\nShadow Ink Gland\nShadow Tentacles\nShark Tongue\nSmall Sunteeth\nStink Lung\nSunshark Blubber\nSunshark Bone\nSunshark Fin\n\nStrategy.\nSee Sunstalker/Strategy\n\nkingdom-death-sunstalker-01_1024x1024.jpg\nkingdom-death-sunstalker-12_1024x1024.jpg\n\nSee Also.\nInfant Sunstalker\nShade\nThe Great Devourer\n\nReferences.",
