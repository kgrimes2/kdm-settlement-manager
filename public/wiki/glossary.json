Fighting arts can have additional costs or prerequisites to use, but usually have exciting effects. \n\nEach fighting art has a corresponding card in the Fighting Art deck that describes the rules for using it. When a survivor gains a fighting art, record it on the survivor record sheet. Survivors can have up to 3 fighting arts.

Except for gear with the weapon keyword, no survivor may have more than one copy of a gear card in their grid.\n\nThere are several types of gear: standard, rare gear, pattern gear, starting gear and promo gear.\n\nRules.\n\nFist & Tooth.\nFist & Tooth describes a survivor fighting with their bare hands, and is a weapon available to all survivors. The rules for using Fist & Tooth are listed on the left side of each player's gear grid.\n\nGaining Gear.\nGear cards can be gained in a variety of ways such as crafting them during step 7 of the Settlement Phase, or by gaining them when survivors meet specific gameplay criteria found on the back of the card (e.g. Hope Stealer, Ancient Root, etc.), or through story events, settlement events or hunt events.\n\nDuplicate Gear.\nExcept for weapons, survivors many not have multiple compies of the same gear in their gear grid. A survivor gains the benefits of a weapon's special rules only once, no matter how many copies they have. Additional copies of weapons still contribute affinities.\n\nGear Keywords.\nKeywords are used to describe gear's important features. Gear keywords may be referenced by events, monster cards (AI Cards or Hit Location Cards), or other rules.\n\nFor example, the Bone Earrings item requires survivors to only have bone gear in their gear grid to gain its bonus. This refers to gear with the bone keyword.\n\nGear Special Rules.\nSpecial rules are listed at the bottom of some gear cards. These rules include special abilities and limitations (e.g. weapons can be Savage or Frail).\n\nThe rules of lower-level gear are explained on their cards. However, rules on some higher-level gear are referenced by name only. Full explanations of all gear special rules can be found in the Glossary.\n\nSome gear cards will have a number in a black box. This number references a gear special rule found on the back side of the gear card (e.g. Black Ghost Dagger.\n\nActivation Costs.\nSome gear require an additional cost from the survivor in order to use them. The most common cost associated with using a gear is spending an activation (), but other costs, such as spending survival, or suffering damage, also appear on gear cards.\n\nSome gear functions differently if survivors are insane, have a certain amount of survival, or meet attribute requirements. Any requirements will be noted in the rules descriptions or explained in the glossary.\n\nAffinities.\nSome gear cards have red, blue, or green half-squares on the card edge. If a half-square is adjacent to another half-square of the same color, the complete square forms 1 affinity.\n\nSome gear cards have affinity bonuses that impart special effects on the survivor if the affinity requirements are met.\n\nAffinity requirements are indicated by a number of small colored squares in the gear's special rules ( ). Each colored square represents one affinity that must be in a survivor's gear grid. You must have the affinities the rule specifies in order to gain the bonus of the gear.\n\nPuzzle Affinities\nIn addition, some affinity bonuses can only be gained if the affinities are completed on that specific card (indicated by puzzle pieces instead of boxes ). Instead of completing affinities anywhere on the grid, they must complete the specific affinities attached to the edges of that gear card.\n\nAffinity Bonus Limit.\nAn affinity bonus from a piece of gear is only gained once. In addition, you cannot gain a second affinity bonus from a second identical gear.\nE.g. A survivor with a total of 5 blue affinities will only gain +1 luck from Lucky Charm.\n\nLost Gear and Affinity Bonus.\nIf gear forming part of an affinity is lost during the hunt or showdown and no longer completes affinities in a survivor's gear grid, any affinity bonuses relying on these affinities are lost.\n\nGaining Gear on a Hunt.\nIf a survivor gains gear during the hunt phase, they may add it to their grid immediately. If their gear grid is full, they must either archive the acquired gear (unless it is cursed) or another piece of gear from the gear grid to make room for the new gear. A gear grid may not be rearranged when this occurs, and the item cannot be added to another survivor's gear grid.\n\nDeath.\nIf survivors persih during the Hunt Phase or Showdown, all of their gear (except any gear with the irreplaceable rule) return to the settlement storage unless an event states otherwise. It may not be used by the remaining survivors.\n\nList of Gear.\nCore Game.\nBarber Surgeon.\nAlmanac\nBlue Charm (moved from Stone Circle in 1.6)\nBug Trap\nFirst Aid Kit\nGreen Charm (moved from

The Hunt Board is a 13 space board used during the Hunt Phase to track the movement of the survivors and their quarry and can be found on the reverse side of the Settlement Board. Each monster's story event has a diagram of the hunt board showing where to place monster hunt event cards (indicated by an \"E\"), basic hunt event cards (indicated by an empty space), and the monster miniature. There is also a Start space where the survivors are placed at the beginning of the Hunt, the Overwhelming Darkness space, and the [[Starvation space at the end of the board.\n\n.]]\n\nRules.\n\nWhen setting up the hunt board follow these steps:\nShuffle the monster's hunt event cards. Place one monster hunt event card from the deck facedown on all spaces indicated with an \"E\" on the hunt board diagram.\nPlace one basic hunt event card in every open space on the hunt board except those occupied by a monster hunt event card, the Start space, Overwhelming Darkness, and Starvation.\nPlace any special hunt event cards on any space that has a basic hunt event card, or monster hunt event card.\nPlace the monster's miniature on the hunt board, accordingto its level, in the space indicated on the hunt board diagram.\nPlace the departing survivor miniatures on the Start space of the hunt board.\n\nIf the survivors move into the same space as the monster on their hunt turn, the hunt phase is over, and the Showdown Phase begins immediately. Do not resolve any hunt events (except Starvation) on the hunt board space occupied by the monster.\n\nReaching Overwhelming Darkness.\nThe first time in a hunt the survivors move into the Overwhelming Darkness space, they trigger the Overwhelming Darkness story event.\n\nThe survivors cannot skip Overwhelming Darkness. If they move, through the space for any reason, instead, stop the hunt board movement and resolve Overwhelming Darkness (before any other events or effects on this space). Resolve any other events on this space then continue to the next space on the hunt board. \n\nIf for some reason, the survivors move into or through Overwhelming Darkness more than once in a single hunt phase, treat it as a blank space.\n\nReaching the Forest Gate.\nThe Flower Knight and Spidicules hunt board setup places the Forest Gate special hunt event card over the Overwhelming Darkness space. When survivors encounter this space, trigger The Forest Wants What It Wants story event. The space retains all of its normal rules, and cannot be skipped or ignored.\nAmbush.\nIf the monster moves into the survivors' hunt board space, the survivors are ambushed End any current hunt events and start the showdown immediately.\n\nIf the survivors are ambushed by the monster, they must skip their first turn. In most case, this means that the monster will take two turns.\n\nSome hunt events allow the survivors to ambush the monster. When the monster is ambushed, survivors may choose to go first in the showdown. Do not follow the setup rules for terrain on the monster's story event. Instead, place the listed showdown terrain, the monster, and survivors on the showdown board as the players decide (setup rules on terrain cards must still be followed).\n\nCompulsory Movement.\nSome hunt events or effects may move the survivors. When this happens, move the group the indicated number of spaces forward or backwards. The survivors cannot move past the Start space or the Starvation space.\n\nMonster Movement.\nMonsters cannot move off of the hunt board. If a hunt event, effect, or rule would move a monster off the hunt board, they stop on the last space.\n\nStarvation.\nIf you fight a monster on the Starvation space, the hunting team takes too long to bring food back home. Apply the rules of the Starvation space of the hunt board (lose 1d5 resources from the storage).",

There are 3 types of hunt event cards: basic, monster, and special. After placing hunt event cards on the hunt board the survivors take turns as the event revealer. The event revealer draws the top event card in the survivors' current space, reads it aloud to the other players, and follows the rules on the card.\n\nWhen an event is complete, the card is archived and the next survivor becomes the event revealer.\n\nIf no cards remain in the survivors' space, the survivors move one space toward the monster and the event revealer draws the top event card in the new space and follows the rules.\n\nHunt event cards are resolved one at a time, from top to bottom. Unless compelled to move by an event, the survivors must resolve all hunt events in their currently occupied space before moving. The monster does not move unless an event specifies otherwise.\n\nIf there are not hunt event cards on a hunt board space when the survivors move into the space, the event revealer makes 1 roll on the hunt event table before the survivors can move to the next hunt board space unless specifically directed to skip spaces. \n\nDuring each hunt, the first time the survivors land on the Overwhelming Darkness space, trigger the Overwhelming Darkness story event instead of rolling on the hunt event table.\n\nBasic.\n\nBasic hunt event cards are mostly identical. They often direct the event revealer to roll 1d100 on the hunt event table found in the Kingdom Death: Monster core rulebook. Additional basic hunt events that do not reference the hunt event table have been added to the game in expansion content (e.g. Sword in the Stone, Baby and the Sword, Object of Desire, etc.). Basic hunt event cards are added to the hunt board on any blank spaces except for the Start space, Overwhelming Darkness, or Starvation. \n\nMonster.\n Prowling Lion Monster Hunt Event card back/front, from Core set.]]\nMonster hunt event cards are only encountered when hunting a particular monster. They describe pitfalls and wonders specific to this monster. Each huntable monster has a unique set of hunt event cards. When setting up the hunt board during the Hunt Phase, monster hunt events are added to all spaces on the hunt board diagram as indicated by an \"E\".\n\nSpecial.\nSpecial hunt event cards are special cards that are only added to the hunt board when the survivors are hunting as specific quarry monster (as is the case with The Forest Gate), or when the survivors are carrying specific gear, or have fulfilled gameplay criteria. These cards are placed on top of existing monster or basic hunt event cards once the hunt board has been set up. \n\nThe Forest Gate special hunt event card is unique in that it is always placed over the Overwhelming Darkness space.",

      "term": "Hunt Phase",
      "definition": "One of the main game phases for Kingdom Death: Monster alongside the Settlement Phase and the Showdown Phase. During the Hunt Phase, players will choose a quarry, set up the hunt board and trigger hunt events until a showdown begins or the hunt fails.\n\nHunt Phase Steps.\n\nTable Setup.\nPlace the hunt board (the opposite side of the settlement board) on the table. Place the players gear rids, and record sheets of the survivors that compose the hunt team on the table.\n\nChoose Your Quarry.\nBefore departing on a hunt, the players will choose a quarry from the list of available monster of the Quarry List of their Settlement Record Sheet. Some monsters cannot be hunted, and only appear as a result of story events or nemesis encounters on the timeline (i.e. the Butcher, Slenderman or The Hand). If this is a nemesis encounter, skip the hunt phase and move directly to the showdown.\n\nChoose the Monster Level.\nThe players should decide the level of the monster. Higher level monster typically grant rare resources and gear, though the higher the level, the more difficult it will be to hunt and defeat. \n\nSet Up the Hunt.\nThe hunt is the survivors' journey to find their quarry. Survivors travel along the hunt board, facing perils along the way.\n\nHunt Board.\nThe Hunt Board has 13 spaces, including a starting space, the Overwhelming Darkness space, and the Starvation space.\n\nHunt Event Cards.\nThere are three types of hunt event cards, basic hunt event cards, monster hunt event cards and special hunt event cards. Basic hunt event cards describe events survivors may encounter out in the darkness; monster hunt event cards describe events that occur while tracking a specific monster; and special hunt event cards are triggered when survivors have specific gear or meet certain gameplay criteria.\n\nHunt Board Setup.\nEach monster's story event has a diagram of the hunt board showing where to place a monster's hunt event cards and the monster's miniature.\n1. Shuffle the monster's hunt event cards. Place one monster hunt event card from the deck facedown on all spaces indicated with an \"E\" on the hunt board diagram.\n2. Place one basic hunt event card in every open space on the hunt board except those occupied by a monster hunt event card, the Start space, the Overwhelming Darkness space and the Starvation space.\n3. Place any special hunt event cards on any space except those occupied by the Start space, the Overwhelming Darkness space and the Starvation space. The only exception to this rule is The Forest Gate special hunt event card, that is always placed on the Overwhelming Darkness space.\n4. Place the monster's miniature on the hunt board, according to its level, in the space indicated on the hunt board diagram.\n5. Place the departing survivors on the Start space of the hunt board.\n\nHunt Your Quarry.\nSurvivors take turns as the event revealer. The event revealer draws the top event card in the survivors' current space, reads it aloud to the other players, and follows the rules on the card. When an event is complete, the card is archived and the next survivor becomes the event revealer. If no cards remain in the survivors' space, the survivors move one space toward the monster and the event revealer draws the top event card in the new space and follows the rules on the card.\n\nHunt event cards are resolved one at a time, from top to bottom. Unless compelled to move by an event, the survivors must resolve all hunt events in their currently occupied space before moving. The monster does not move unless an event specifies otherwise.\n\nIf there are not hunt event cards on a hunt board space when the survivors move into the space, the event revealer makes 1 roll on the hunt event table before the survivors can move to the next hunt board space unless specifically directed to skip spaces. \n\nDuring each hunt, the first time the survivors land on the Overwhelming Darkness space, trigger the Overwhelming Darkness story event instead of rolling on the hunt event table.\n\nFind the Quarry.\nIf the survivors move into the same space as the monster on their hunt turn, the hunt phase is over, and the Showdown Phase begins immediately. Do not resolve any hunt events (except Starvation) on the hunt board space occupied by the monster.\n\nHunt Event Cards.\nMost basic hunt event cards are identical and direct the event revealer to roll on the hunt event table to determine what happens next. Some basic hunt event cards introduced in expansions (e.g. Baby and the Sword, Object of Desire, Dead Warrior, etc.) have event text printed on them and will be resolved by reading the card. \n\nThe basic hunt event table lists 100 possible events the survivors may encounter. The event revealer rolls \"1d100\" to randomly determine the event. Tol roll 1d100, take 2d10 and nominate one die to be tens and one die to be ones. Roll them together for a result between 1 and 100.\nEx: If the tens die result is \"3\", and the ones die result is \"5\", the event number is \"35\". Trigger hunt event 35 on the hunt event table, read it aloud, and resolve it.\n\nReaching Overwhelming Darkness.\nThe first time in a hunt the survivors move into the Overwhelming Darkness space, they trigger the Overwhelming Darkness story event.\n\nThe survivors cannot skip Overwhelming Darkness. If they move, through the space for any reason, instead, stop the hunt board movement and resolve Overwhelming Darkness (before any other events or effects on this space). Resolve any other events on this space then continue to the next space on the hunt board. \n\nIf for some reason, the survivors move into or through Overwhelming Darkness more than once in a single hunt phase, treat it as a blank space.\n\nReaching the Forest Gate.\nThe Flower Knight and Spidicules hunt board setup places the Forest Gate special hunt event card over the Overwhelming Darkness space. When survivors encounter this space, trigger The Forest Wants What It Wants story event. The space retains all of its normal rules, and cannot be skipped or ignored.\n\nGaining Gear on the Hunt.\nIf a survivor gains gear during the hunt phase, they may add it to their grid immediately. If their gear grid is full, they must either archive the acquired gear (unless it is cursed) or another piece of gear from the gear grid to make room for the new gear. A gear grid may not be rearranged when this occurs, and the item cannot be added to another survivor's gear grid.\n\nEvent Damage.\nSurvivors may suffer damage during the hunt. This is event damage and is non-lethal. Event damage will still reduce armor points and insanity, cause light and heavy injuries, but will not cuase severe injuries or brain trauma. Any damage accrued on the hunt persists into the showdown phase.\n\nAny tokens gained on the hunt remain through the aftermath of the following showdown or the beginning of the next settlement phase, which ever comes first.\n\nSevere Injuries and Brain Trama.\nIn special cases, survivors may suffer severe injuries or brain traumas during the hunt. The cases will be clearly indicated on an event.\n\nApply any attribute modifiers, impairments, and restrictions from injuries and brain traumas suffered on the hunt to the showdown that follows it (including bleeding tokens). If you must skip the next hunt as a result of an injury, this refers to the next hunt, not the remainder of the current one.\n\nRetire on the Hunt.\nIf a survivor retires during the hunt, they participate in the coming showdown and return to the settlement with any victorious survivors. When they return, they retire, never to hunt again.\n\nDeath of the Hunt.\nIf survivors perish during the hunt phase, all of their gear (except any gear with the irreplaceable rule) returns to the settlement storage unless the event states otherwise. It may not be used by the remaining survivors on the hunt.\n\nAmbush.\nIf the monster moves into the survivors' hunt board space, the survivors are ambushed End any current hunt events and start the showdown immediately.\n\nIf the survivors are ambushed by the monster, they must skip their first turn. In most case, this means that the monster will take two turns.\n\nSome hunt events allow the survivors to ambush the monster. When the monster is ambushed, survivors may choose to go first in the showdown. Do not follow the setup rules for terrain on the monster's story event. Instead, place the listed showdown terrain, the monster, and survivors on the showdown board as the players decide (setup rules on terrain cards must still be followed).\n\nCompulsory Movement.\nSome hunt events or effects may move the survivors. When this happens, move the group the indicated number of spaces forward or backwards. The survivors cannot move past the Start space or the Starvation space.\n\nMonster Movement.\nMonsters cannot move off of the hunt board. If a hunt event, effect, or rule would move a monster off the hunt board, they stop on the last space.\n\nStarvation.\nIf you fight a monster on the Starvation space, the hunting team takes too long to bring food back home. Apply the rules of the Starvation space of the hunt board (lose 1d5 resources from the storage).\n\nThe Hunt Fails.\nIf the survivors perish on the hunt, the Hunt Phase ends and the quarry is lost.\n\nApply the rules on the Starvation space of the hunt board. The lantern year is over, and a new Settlement Phase begins.\nRun Away.\nIf the settlement has innovated Pictographs, survivors may attempt to flee. After a hunt event is resolved, you many nominate any number of survivors and trigger the Run Away story event. Each nominated survivor rolls individually on the story event.",

The Throne, etc.), but can be acquired when certain gameplay circumstances are met.\n\nRules.\nWhen gained innovations will grant a settlement to persistent benefits such as unlocking survival actions, increasing the settlement's survival limit, or providing opportunities for survivors to endeavor.

Seed Patterns introduce a source of wild ideas, a table to fabricate outrageous new designs that provide novel solutions to gameplay challenges. \n\nDefeat Indomitable monsters to obtain new resources that rouse the survivors' imagination.\n\nSeed patterns offer a settlement an ongoing source of new invention. Survivors living with a Drafting Table constantly discover new configurations of resources and gear. The mysterious origin of their ideas is a small price to pay for the potential benefits they present. \n\nPatterns.\n Pattern card back/front, from White Sunlion Armor - Ezra Promo white box.]]\nPatterns have a novel arrangement of resources that allows settlements to craft gear not found at settlement locations. When a moment of inspiration strikes, survivors gain a pattern card.\n\nAdd Patterns to Campaigns.\nPatterns can appear in any campaign. Their inclusion is based on the components that make up your campaign. Patterns are not optional.\n\nPattern Cards.\n\nPattern cards show the settlement how to build a specific pattern gear.\n\nName: The name of the pattern and the corresponding pattern gear\nCrafting limit: The total quantity of this pattern gear that your settlement can have at any time\nResource cost: The resources you must spend to craft this pattern gear\n\nGaining Patterns.\nSurvivors find inspiration everywhere, from an introspective moment to the sight of an overgrown monster organ. The game will instruct you to gain a pattern.\n\nIn the Gambler's Chest Expansion, patterns are gained by defeating high-level quarry monsters and exploring arc survivor philosophies.\n\nIndomitable Resources.\nThe Gambler's Chest Expansion quarry monsters have indomitable resources in addition to monster resources. They are rewarded to survivors who defeat level 3+ monsters. These monster parts are such outstanding specimens, they often inspire patterns.\n\nAdd Patterns to the Settlement.\nWhen you gain a pattern, take the corresponding pattern card from the pattern cards in your collection and move it to the settlement's pattern cards. List it in the Patterns section of the arc settlement record sheet.\n\nDuring settlement setup, place all settlement patterns on the table.\n\nCrafting Pattern Gear.\nDuring the Develop step of the Settlement Phase, you can craft any pattern gear as you would gear at a settlement location. Ensure you have the necessary resources on the pattern card, spend and archive those resources, and gain the corresponding pattern gear card.\n\nSeed Patterns.\n Seed Pattern card back/front, from Gambler's Chest expansion. Current Seed Pattern card style.]]\nSeed patterns are an optional component you can add to a campaign. Seed Patterns come from an enigmatic font of ideas that continues to inspire new gear schematics.\n\nNegative Seed Patterns.\nSome seed patterns appear with negative-numbered White Box releases. Negative patterns are wild ideas that could arise in a survivor's head but may not find comfort in a more serious campaign. Players should all agree if they want to add negative patterns to their campaign.\n\n Seed Pattern card back/front, from Summer Goth white box. Old original Seed Pattern card style.]]\nAdding Seed Patterns.\nTo add seed patterns to a campaign, you will need to add the \"First survivor to reach 3 understanding settlement milestone to the settlement record sheet. This milestone triggers Designs and Dandelions.\n\nCurrent Campaign.\nIf a survivor has already reached 3+ understanding, reach the new settlement milestone during the Check Milestones step of your next Settlement Phase.\n\nSeed Pattern Cards.\nSeed Pattern cards allow survivors to craft perplexing gear with bizarre crafting challenges. Each Seed Pattern card consists of the following parts:\nName: The name of the seed pattern and the corresponding seed pattern gear.\nKeywords: The keywords that determine which seed patterns belong in your campaign.\nNumber: A unique number (negative or positive) to organize your seed patterns.\nCrafting Limit: The total quantity of this pattern gear that the settlement can have at any time.\nDiagram: Shows an image of the pattern gear and the crafting process. For illustrative purposes only.\\\nEra: Eras are noted in roman numerals I - IV, corresponding to monster nodes 1 - 4. Craft this gear with resources from monsters in this or a later era. Prior to the release of the Gambler's Chest Expansion, eras were refered to as \"arcs\".\nCost: Lists the components that must be spent (archived) to craft this gear. These can be specific resource cards, resource types (constrained by the pattern's era), gear, vermin, etc.\nCrafting Steps: The steps required to fabricate this seed pattern gear. Icons next to each step appear in three colors that denote the type of step.\n\nGray steps are storytelling without rules.\n\nBlue steps tell a story that includes a requirement (in bold) that must be met to craft this gear. \n\nPurple steps describe outcomes of crafting this gear. Some outcomes are tragic consequences, others are unexpected boons.\n\nCrafting steps have requirements (in bold) that must be met to craft seed pattern gear. In addition to resource costs, requirements are needed to craft this gear but are neither spent nor archived. These requirements are broad, ranging from gear and settlement locations to survivors with specific attributes.\n\nCreating the Seed Pattern Deck.\nExamine the keywords on all seed pattern cards to determine which cards to keep and which to set aside.\n\nIf your campaign has all the keywords listed on a card, keep the card. Keywords are often monsters or game components (e.g., White Lion, Scout, etc). If any keyword is not in your campaign, your settlement cannot build the gear. Do not use that seed pattern.\n\nAdding Base Seed Cards.\nMany seed patterns only have the seed keyword. These base seed patterns should all be addded to the settlement's seed pattern deck.\n\nShuffle all the aforementioned cards together to create the settlement's seed pattern deck. Draw from this deck when instructed to gain a seed pattern. \n\nGaining Seed Patterns.\nwhen survivors gain a seed pattern, draw a random card from the settlement's seed pattern cards. Update the Seed Patterns list on the settlement record sheet. Use the provided deck dividers to organize your collection and current campaign.\n\nThe Drafting Table Innovation.\nThe Drafting Table innovation alters the revelatory moment survivors experience when they reach 3+ understanding. Enchanced by the presence of the Drafting Table in the settlement, survivors are suddenly struck by transcendent inspiration. \n\nSurvivors may reach 3+ understanding at many moments in a lantern year. When they do, resolve any story events (such as Insight, then gain the benefits of Drafting Table (draw a seed pattern card).\n\nEven if they are away, the sheer magnitude of this earthshaking revelation ripples instantly through the settlement. Add the seed pattern to the settlement's seed pattern list when it is gained.\n\nCrafting Seed Pattern Gear.\nThe process of crafting a seed pattern gear is inspired by wild dreams and otherworldly influences. It is often a bizarre and intricate journey. during the Develop step of the settlement phase, craft any seed pattern gear in your settlement by fulfilling all requirements of the seed pattern crafting process. Unless all elements of the crafting process can be completed, the gear cannot be crafted.\n\nSpend the Cost.\nThe components listed as part of a seed pattern's cost must be archived in the process of crafting that seed pattern gear. Unlike most gear, the cost of seed pattern gear is not limited to resources.\n\nSpecific Era Costs.\nIf the cost includes a resource types (bone, organ, hide, etc.) instead of a named resource card, these resources must come from a monster (not basic resources), and that monster must appear in the era of that seed pattern or later.\n\nEx. an Itemsmith's Lens (Era II) costs 1x Broken Lantern and 1x Organ. The settlement spends a Broken Lantern basic resource and a resource with the organ keyword from their Node 2 quarry monster (Screaming Antelope, Spidicules, Flower Knight, Smog Singers, etc.).\n\nComplete the Crafting Steps.\nThe peculiar steps of crafting seed pattern gear are listed on the card. These steps have terms in bold that are requirements. They must be present in your settlement to complete steps but are not archived or removed from your settlement. These are varied and can include anything from gear keywords, survivor that have reached certain miulestones or suffered inc ertain ways, and even story events that have been triggered. Required events will specify if they must occur this lantern year. If there is any uncertainty about met requirements, meet them again after the seed pattern is discoverd to craft the gear.\n\nSteps marked with a blue icon may tell a story of how requirement s are used. Steps with a purple icon describe transformations that occur as a result of the crafting process. Update all survivors, gear, and items that change as you complete the crafting proccess of a seed pattern gear.\n\nGain Seed Pattern Gear.\nWhen the cost is spent and the crafting steps are completed, gain the seed pattern gear and return the card to the settlement's earned seed pattern cards.\n\nList of Pattern Cards.\nBeast Kunai\nBlood Drinker\nBone Chibouk\nColossal Chef's Carver\nCruel Cleaver\nCurse Hammer\nDiamond Scab Katar\nDiscordian\nDome Buster\nDrum of Hope\nFear Spear\nImmortal Arm\nHeartbow\nHeartstop Arrows\nRegal Plume\nRegicider\nSaxe\nSeditioner\nUnbreakable Zanbato\nViolet Armor Charm\nViolet Phoenix Faulds\nViolet Phoenix Gauntlets\nWhite Sunlion Mask\nBeast Kunai\nLongclaw\nUpstage Scarf\nScreaming Tanto\nScreaming Sun Mask\nStampede Glaive\nGusk Knife\nLordsruin\nGreatest Gaxe\nCount Sandals\nCount Tabard\nCount Treukh\nCount Vest\nCount Wrappings\nEarl Boots\nEarl Jaw Guard\nEarl Raiment\nEarl Sleeves\nEarl Tassests\nMarchioness Blouse\nMarchioness Gloves\nMarchioness Gorget\nMarchioness Solleretes\nMarchioness Trousers\nGrimacing Guillotine\nJaw Saw\n\nList of Postiive Seed Pattern Cards.\n001 - Raw Hide Bandana\n002 - Elder's Aegis\n003 - Lucky Cat Fang Knife\n004 - Imitation Butcher Mask\n005 - Monster Trophy\n006 - Sprinter Armor\n007 - Dream Keeper Knife\n008 - Dream Keeper Cowl\n009 - Fingernail Whip\n010 - Shadow Skleaver\n011 - Tithe Box\n012 - Cyclops Ledger\n013 - ???\n014 - Beaster Hunter Helm\n015 - Hushing Harmonium\n016 - Itemsmith's Lens\n017 - Armorsmith's Tongs\n018 - Weaponsmith's Hammer\n019 - Ornate Rapier\n020 - True Lantern Halberd\n021 - Masamune\n022 - Jarngreipr\n023 - Backstabbing Stone\n024 - Master Bone Dagger\n025 - Heartseeker\n026 - Death Defier\n027 - Mighty Bone Axe\n028 - Reaperjaw\n029 - Ghost Garters - Legs\n030 - Ghost Garters - Arms\n031 - Ghostlink Pumpkin\n032 - Scythe of Doom\n033 - Robes of Dedheim\n034 - Piercing Claws\n035 - Clasping Shield\n036 - Spite Balm\n037 - Refined Lantern Halberd\n038 - Soldier Lantern Cuirass\n040 - Sundering Crossbow\n041 - Lagamorph Kanabo\n042 - Refined Lantern Sword\n045 - Spinal Sickle\n046 - Bravelink Pumpkin\n047 - Hollowlink Pumpkin \n048 - Sword of Doom\n\nList of Negative Seed Pattern Cards.\n-001 - Vault Key Earrings\n-002 - Plated Shield\n-003 - Tempered Spear\n-004 - Tempered Axe\n-005 - Tempered Dagger\n-006 - Telcric Eye Tac\n-007 - Durendal\n-008 - Afterdeath Brew\n-009 - Brave Dirndl\n-010 - Black Ghost Dagger\n-011 - Brazen Bat\n-012 - Vixen Tail\n-013 - ???\n-014 - Grim Muffler\n-015 - Gold Cat Costume\n-016 - Screaming Costume\n-017 - Retching Costume\n-018 - Big Bite Costume\n-019 - Hypersight Visor\n-020 - Plasma Cutter\n-021 - Blackstar Bikini\n-022 - Neko Twilight Armor\n-023 - Flower Costume\n-024 - Jack O' Lantern\n-025 - King Costume\n-026 - Vivid Bian Pao",

      "definition": "Philosophies are a system of rules used in Kingdom Death: Monster. They were introduced as part of the Gambler's Chest Expansion.\n\nPhilosophies.\nWhen they come of age, arc survivors adopt philosophies to make sense of their nightmarish world.\n\nEach philosophy allows arc survivors to see the world with new eyes. As they age, they explore these beliefs, leading them to uncover knowledge that may outlast their brief existence. Survivors adopt philosophies from philosophy cards.\n\nPhilosophy Cards.\n Philosophy card back/front, from Gambler's Chest Expansion.]]\nPhilosophy cards represent a philosophy survivors can adopt. They have a name, type (Core, Starting, Tier 1, Tier 2, Tier 3, and Systematic) and direct your survivor how to adopt this philosophy.\n\nPhilosophy Deck.\nThe philosophy deck contains cards that represent all the philosophies arc survivors of a settlement can adopt.\n\nAt the beginning of a campaign, this deck is small. When a new philosophy is acquired, it is added to the deck for survivors to gain. If a philosophy card is removed from the deck, that outlook is no longer possible to adopt in the settlement.\n\nThere are six types of philosophies represented on philosophy cards:\n\nCore: The campaign's core monster inspires a settlement's core philosophy. In the case of People of the Dream Keeper, this is Dreamism.\n\nStarting: Each campaign begins with a philosophy that represents survivors' basic fears and needs.\n\nTier 1: These philosophies appear more obvious or easier to grasp. Philosophy decks start with two random Tier 1 philosophies.\n\nTier 2: Settlements do not start with the more complicated or esoteric Tier 2 philosophies. They must reach new levels of sophistication and unlock them using collective cognition.\n\nTier 3: Powerful ways of thought unlocked by reaching the highest levels of collective cognition.\n\nSystemic: Significant events in the campaign may add these to your philosophy deck.\n\nCreate the Philosophy Deck.\nIn the first lantern year of an arc survivor campaign, the Philosophy deck is created during the First Meal story. It consists of the following:\n\n1 Core philosophy\n1 Starting philosophy\n2 random Tier 1 philosophies\n\nIn the Dream Keeper campaign, this will be four cards: Survivalism (Starting philosophy), Dreamism (Core philosophy), and two random Tier 1 philosophies.\n\nAdopting a Philosophy.\nDuring the Develop step of the settlement phase, arc survivors who have reached their first Hunt XP milestone (Hunt XP 2) adopt a philosophy.\n\nAlthough some arc survivors reach this milestone in the Aftermath of a showdown, they adopt philosophies only during quiet moments of reflection in the settlement.\n\nWhen an arc survivor adopts a philosophy, get the corresponding philosophy book and open to the starting page.\n\nPhilosophy Books.\n Philosophy book front/back, from Gambler's Chest Expansion.]]\nPhilosophies evolve with experience. This intellectual journey is represented in the philosophy books.\n\nEach philosophy book contains a starting page that describes the basic consequences of the outlook. Philosophy ranks follow, telling the story of how the philosophy changes.\n\nPhilosophy Starting Page.\nPhilosophies are critical to an arc survivor's identity and will influence their behavior and development. At the outset, philosophy books describe the fundamental ways in which a philosophy guides their behavior.\n\nHunt XP Milestones. The pace at which a worldview develops. Each philosophy has its own Hunt XP milestones that indicate when its ranks increase. Record these by bolding matching boxes on the arc survivor record sheet Hunt XP track.\n\nTenet Knowledge. Knowledge is essential to any worldview. When you adopt a philosophy, take the corresponding knowledge card and record the tenet's name, rules, observation conditions, and the quantity of observation boxes on your record sheet.\n\nNeurosis. Every outlook has its pitfalls. Record the neurosis and its rules on the arc survivor record sheet.\n\nRank 1. After recording philosophy details on the starting page, advance to rank 1 by turning the page and resolving the story.\n\nPhilosophy Ranks.\nEach rank of a philosophy represents an evolution of thought. The Hunt XP milestones on a book's starting page note that philosophy's progression. Rank 1 is reached when the philosophy is adopted.\n\nWhen you resolve a rank, a different player should read the story and only the results you achieve (usually your roll result) to preserve the novelty of your unique path through this philosophy.\n\nAttribute Increases.\nArc survivors gain attributes as a result of their philosophies. Unless explicitly described as a token, attribute increases/decreases are permanent.\n\nDivergent Ranks.\nPhilosophy ranks are achieved only through leaps of logic. Conditions for obtaining these ranks are listed after the starting page. Once you reach the divergent rank, there are no further ranks in this philosophy.\n\nPhilosophies Benefit from Collective Cognition.\nPhilosophy roll results may have effects only reached at a collective cognition threshold. Gain these effects if you roll the appropriate result (usually highlighted in blue) and if your settlement's collective cognition is equal to or higher than the listed number.\n\nIntrospection.\nSome philosophy ranks have an Introspection at the bottom. Gain the effects of an Introspection only if your settlement has reached the listed CC threshold.\n\nAdopting Systemic Philosophies.\nSystemic philosophies are adopted at significant moments in your settlement's history.\n\nAdopting New Philosophies.\nIf a game event allows or forces a survivor to adopt a new philosophy, they start at the beginning (starting page) of that philosophy and reach rank 1. Replace their tenet, neurosis, rank, and Hunt XP milestones with those of their new philosophy.\n\nDo not reset a survivor's Hunt XP when they adopt a new philosophy. Examine the Hunt XP milestones of the new philosophy. If the survivor has already achieved any of these new Hunt XP milestones, they must wait until the next settlement phase in which they are a returning survivor, then ponder.\n\nSurvivors Ponder Philosophies.\nEach lantern year, returning survivors ponder their existence at the settlement. This occurs during the Develop phase of the settlement phase. In addition to building and crafting, arc survivors reflect on their experiences and develop new worldviews. This is how they advance the ranks of their adopted philosophy.\n\nThey Must Ponder.\nReturning survivors who reached a new Hunt XP milestone must ponder their philosophy. They may do so, at any point during the develop step. When they do they gain the next rank of their philosophy. Turn to the next rank's page in the philosophy book and have another player read the story aloud. If prompted, roll and record the results.\n\nA survivor can increase their philosophy rank only once per settlement phase. Survivors who gain enough Hunt XP to achieve more than one Hunt XP milestone only gain the next rank of their philosophy. They must wait until the next settlement phase to ponder and gain another rank.\n\nKeep the settlement's total collective cognition in mind. If you earned them, gain collective cognition benefits for your roll result and Introspection.\n\nOnce per Lifetime.\nA survivor can gain the benefits of each rank in their philosophy only once per lifetime.",

There are 4 kinds of resources: Basic Resources. Monster Resources, Strange Resources, and Vermin Resources. Indomitable Resources were introduced in the Gambler's Chest Expansion.\n\nRules.\nAll resources have shared types. Resource types include: bone, hide, organ, scrap, herb, vermin, and consumable.. Some costs are listed by type (e.g. 3x bone and 2x organ) and any resource of that type may be spent. For instance, a Lion Claw monster resource may be spent as bone. However, some costs list specific respurces by name. No substitutions may occur in these cases. If a recipe has \"resource\" listed as a cost, then any resource card can be used.\n\nWhen a resource is spent, archive the corresponding card or remove its entry form the settlement's storage.\n\nBasic Resources.\n Basic Resource card back/front, from Core set.]]\nThe core game contains 21 basic resources, but additional basic resources (e.g. Perfect Bone, Lump of Atnas, etc.) have been added to the game through expansion content. Survivors earn them from events and defeating monsters.\n\nMonster Resources.\n Lion Claw Monster Resource card back/front, from Core set.]]\nMonster resource cards are only gained from fighting that type of monster. There are seperate decks for all huntable monsters.\n\nStrange Resources.\n Strange Resource card back/front, from Core set.]]\nStrange resource cards are resources that are only gained in specific circumstances. These are unique and difficult to come by. Strange resources can be extremely rare monster part, refined metals, and useful herbs. Gain strange resources as directed by events in the game. \n\nStrange resources are not considered part of a monster's pool of resource cards.\n\nVermin Resources.\n Vermin Resource card back/front, from Core set.]]\nThe fauna of Kingdom Death has a variety of small, bizarre species. These are represented by vermin resource cards. They can be found in Bug Patches during showdowns and sometimes as a result of events. Vermin cards have rules that describe how each vermin can be used. Vermin can also be cooked using the Cooking innovation to produce excellent results!\n\nSurvivors Gaining Resources.\n Overgrown Dewclaw Indomitable Resource card back/front, from the Longclaw Lenore Indomitable Survivor expansion set.]]\nWhen a survivor gains a resource, draw a card from the appropriate resource deck and place it next to their gear grid in the play area. The survivor is now carrying this resource. It has no effect on the survivor's ability to fight or hunt.\n\nAny resources a survivor gains during the hunt and showdown are places beside the survivor's gear grid. Survivors may spend these resources or activate a resource's rules at any time during these phases.\n\nIf resources are gained during the Settlement Phase, place them in the play area.\n\nGroups Gaining Resources.\nWhen a monster is defeated, the players collect the rewards listed on the monster's story event. All living survivors need to decide how to divide them. Sharing and spending resources will greatly affect the outcomes of your campaign. Some groups may divide resources fairly, then trade them. Others may pool resources together and spend them as a group.\n\nResource Limit.\nWhen you are directed to gain a resource and that specific card is not currently in the resource deck, you do not gain it, nor do you add it to the settlement storage. You gain nothing.\n\nThis situation can occur when an event or effect of a card lists a specific resource to fain, and that resource is currently being carried by a survivor.\n\nResources and Death.\nWhen a survivor dies, or is lost during the Hunt Phase, another survivor simply takes the resources they were carrying.\n\nWhen a survivor dies during the showdown, any resources they were carrying are regained by the group at the end of the showdown during the Aftermath if the survivors were victorious.\n\nWhen all survivors die, all resources they were carrying are lost.\n\nResources with Special Rules.\nSome resources have special rules. They can be performed at any time and during any phase by the survivor holding the resource. Some resources have rules that are triggered when they are gained and should be performed then.\n\nA resource must be removed from settlement storage to use its special rules.

      "definition": "One of the main game phases for Kingdom Death: Monster alongside the Hunt Phase and the Showdown Phase. During the Settlement Phase, survivors will use endeavors and resources to develop the settlement, discover innovations, determine the settlement\ns guiding principles, and craft gear in preparation of fighting the campaign's Finale Monster. Players are encouraged to experiment, implement votes, assign roles, and find new ways to govern their settlement.\n\nSettlement Phase Steps.\n1. Set Up the Settlement.\nPlace the Settlement Board on the table. \nPlace the gear grids and record sheets of any survivors returning from the showdown on the table. \nPlace the Settlement Record Sheet on the table. The settlement record sheet will be updated multiple times throughout a campaign, so be sure to use a pencil (or alternative) for recording changes to the settlement. \nShuffle all of the Settlement Event cards and place them face down in the play area. \nPlacelace any Settlement Locations that the settlement has built in the play area. \nPlace any innovations the settlement has innovated, and Principles the settlement has selected in the play area. \nShuffle the innovation deck and place it face down on its space on the Settlement Board. It should contain all innovations that are consequences of existing innovations in your settlement.\n\n2. Survivors Return.\nAll survivors that endured the previous showdown are returning survivors. When these survivors return to the settlement, their injuries are healed. Erase any filled light or heavy injury levels. Remove all tokens from all survivors.\n\nSurvival and insanity do not automatically replenish. Their values persist until they are changed by gameplay. Likewise, permanent injuries do not heal on their own, but some innovations and events will enable players to heal them.\n\nApply any effects for the returning survivors from principles, settlement events, and innovations. This may include bonuses and penalties. \n\nIt is possible to have no returning survivors if all survivors perished during the hunt or showdown.\n\n3. Gain Endeavors.\nEndeavors are the generative energy returning survivors accumulate from their experiences. The settlement gains 1 for each returning survivor. Use tokens to track endeavours.\n\nSome innovations and principles may grant additional tokens when certain gameplay criteria are met.\n\n4. Update Timeline.\nFill the next unfilled lantern year on the timeline to advance the current lantern year.\nDraw the top card of the settlement event deck ()) and perform the event. Place the card in the play area face up as a remind of any persistent effects the card may have during the settlement phase. Settlement events may have new ways to spend endeavors, build gear, or impart lasting bonuses or restrictions.\nDuring the campaign, specific settlement events may be added to your timeline. When the timeline is updated, resolve these by drawing them from the settlement event deck and playing them (in addition to your random settlement event). The same settlement event card cannot be played more than once per Settlement Phase. \nTrigger any story events that are listed for the current year on the timeline. If there are multiple story events for that lantern year, resolve them one at a time in the order they are listed. If the current year has a Nemesis Encounter story on the timeline, follow the rules for Nemesis monsters.\n\n5. Update the Death Count.\nIf any survivors perished during the previous hunt, showdown, or during the preceding steps of the settlement phase, update the death count on the Settlement Record Sheet to reflect their deaths. If a survivor dies later during the Settlement Phase, update the death count immediately.\n\n6. Check Milestones.\nMilestone story events are conditional events that appear below the timeline. Check the Settlement Record Sheet to see if any milestones have been reached. If you reach more than one milestone at this time, play them in any order. For each milestone, check off its box and trigger the corresponding story event. If a milestone is reached later in the Settlement Phase, check off the box and trigger the event immediately.\n\nIf you are using strain milestones, place any unreached strain milestone cards on the settlement board over the Check Milestones step. During this step, check your strain milestones first, and if you have reached a card's Milestone Condition, resolve its Permanent Effect. If the Strain Milestone unlocks a Strain Fighting Art, add the card to the Fighting Art deck. Remove any reached strain milestone cards from your game. They can never be used again.\n\nIf you are using the Pattern System in your campaign, when a survivor reaches the Insight milestone, the sudden shift in perspective is accompanied by a new idea. Draw a random pattern card from the Pattern deck. Record it on the Settlement Record Sheet. The settlement now has access to the pattern for the remainder of the campaign.\n\n7. Develop.\nDuring this step players will decide, as a group, how to spend the settlement's resources. Players can craft gear, endeavor, innovate, and build.\n\nCrafting Gear\nPlayers may spend resources to craft weapons, armor and items at locations their settlement has built. Each settlement location lists the resource cost for each gear that can be built at that location. When you spend resources to craft gear, archive the resources, and get the gear card you crafted from the game box. It is up to the players to decide whether or not they pool their resources and craft gear as a group or split their resources and craft gear as individuals.\n\nNote that some gear cards have a gear recipe printed on the back of the card, and are not crafted at a specific settlement location (e.g. Gusk Knife, Xmaxe, Tabard). Archive the resources listed in the gears recipe and follow any innovation requirements before gaining the gear.\n\nIf you are using the Pattern System in your campaign, any patterns gained by the settlement during the Check Milestones step may be crafted during this step. Spend the resources in the pattern cards crafting recipe and ensure that all requirements for the crafting process are present (sometimes this may require survivors to have experienced certain gameplay criteria, survivor characteristics, or innovations rather than a resource card), then gain the card. Some pattern cards have a crafting limit that limits the number of copies of that gear that may be crafted.\n\nEndeavor\nSurvivors can spend endeavors to innovate, build new settlement locations, or perform unique activities in the settlement. Whenever a rule on an Innovation, Settlement Location or Settlement event is proceeded by , it indicates that any listed rules or effects cost an endeavor to use them.\n\nTo spend an endeavor, select a survivor to perform the endeavor, reduce the settlement's total endeavors by 1, and follow the rules for the action the endeavor was spent on. Unless stated otherwise, any of the rules effects apply only to the selected survivor.\n\nInnovate\nTo innovate, select a survivor to spend an endeavor and the required resources at the campaigns starting settlement location (e.g. Lantern Hoard, The Sun, The Throne). Follow the rules for innovating on the settlement location.\n\nBuild\nWhen a new location is built, place that settlement location in the play area and add the new location to your settlement record sheet. This is a permanent addition to your settlement.\n\n8. Prepare Departing Survivors.\nAt this point players should decide if they plan to press on to the next hunt phase, or end their play session. If they decide to continue, players must choose 4 eligible departing survivors. If the population is less than 4, choose as many as possible. If there are fewer than 4 players, players must control multiple survivors. Remove the returning survivors' gear and add gear to the departing survivors' gear grids. Record armor points and attribute modifiers imparted from the gear. Be sure to apply any bonuses from innovations, endeavors, or events that affect departing survivors.\n\n9. Special Showdown.\nIf there are any special showdowns listed for the current lantern year on the Settlement Record Sheet, the departing survivors immediately begin a showdown with the named monster. If there are multiple special showdowns on the timeline, do them in the order the are listed.\n\nAfter the showdown, win or lose, return to the Update Death Count step of the current lantern year. Heal survivors and remove their tokens, but they are not considered returning survivors. Do not repeat any preceding settlement phase steps (do not gain , draw , or advance a lantern year).\n\n10. Record & Archive Resources.\nRecord unspent resources in the settlement storage, and archive the corresponding cards. This is an important step to ensure that the full range of possible resources is available in each deck, ready to be drawn again.\n\nResources in the settlement storage may be spent at anytime during the Settlement Phase. When a resource is spent, erase its entry from the storage list.\n\n11. End Settlement Phase.\nAfter all preceding steps have been completed, the players should:\nDiscard any unspent endeavors\nStore settlement innovations\nStore unused gear\nClean up\n\nAny unspent endeavors are lost, they do not carry over to the next settlement phase. \n\nStore your settlement's innovation deck in the alloted space in the game box. Store your settlement's current innovations, principles, and masteries together in the space provided. Place any unused gear in the alloted space in the game box. Retrieve these cards in the future settlement phases (players can keep a written gear list). Finish cleaning the play area by returning the settlement's locations, event cards, and unused survivor record sheets to the game box. Proceed to the Hunt Phase.",

      "definition": "The part of a session where survivors face off against a monster. See individual monster showdown pages for instructions on how to start and end the Showdown Phase.\n\nRules.\nA showdown is a battle between a monster and the survivors. The showdown ends only when the monster or the survivors are defeated.\n\nTable Setup.\nPlace the showdown board, monster control panel, and the gear grids and record sheets of the survivors participating in the showdown on the table.\n\nCreate a Monster.\nTo create a monster, players will need:\nMonster Ai deck\nMonster () cards and any attribute tokens\nMonster hit location deck\nBasic resource deck\nMonster resource deck\nDouble-sided Basic Action / Reference Card\n\nCreating the AI Deck.\nA monster's AI deck is assembled from its pool of unique AI cards. Ai deck construction is different for each monster and also varies by the monster level. Consult the monster attribute section on the monster's showdown story event in the row corresponding to the monster's level. This will indicate the number of basic (), advanced (), and legendary () cards to include.\n\nTo build the deck, set aside the monster's () AI cards. Seperate the monster's Basic, Advanced, and Legendary AI cards into stacks and shuffle each stack. Draw the indicated number of each card type from each stack without looking at them. Combine the resulting cards and shuffle them to create the AI deck. Place the AI deck face down on the monster control panel.\n\nMonster Cards and Attributes.\nEach monster showdown story event lists and () cards and further modifiers that start in play. These are not added to the AI deck. Place these face up on the monster control panel and apply their rules for the duration of the showdown.\n\nBasic Action/Reference Card.\nPlace the double-sided Basic Action / Reference Card on the monster control panel.\n\nResource Decks.\nTake the basic resource deck and shuffle it. Place it face down next to the monster control panel. If the monster has its own monster resource cards, shuffle those and place them face down next to the monster control panel.\n\nShowdown Board Setup.\nTerrain & Deployment.\nEach monster's showdown story event has a Terrain & Deployment section. It lists specific and random terrain to place on the showdown board.\n\nFirst, use any specifically listed terrain cards to set up their corresponding terrain tiles according to the Showdown Setup diagram found on the story event/ If the terrain times are not on the diagram, follow the setup rules on the bottom of each card. Set aside these terrain cards. Next, add random terrain by shuffling the terrain deck and drawing the number of cards specified by the story event. Set up their corresponding terrain tiles, one card at a time, according to the rules on the bottom of each card.\n\nPlace the monster and survivors on the showdown board according to the Showdown Setup diagram. Once the terrain, the monster(s), and the survivors are on the showdown board, the showdown begins.\n\nAdditional terrain: Some effects add extra terrain to the showdown board. Unless direct otherwise, always follow the setup rules on the bottom of the card.\n\nThe Showdown Round.\nThe showdown proceeds in rounds consisting of the monster turn followed by the survivor's turn. Rounds will continue until the monster is dead or all the survivors are dead.\n\nUnless otherwise stated, monsters always go first.\n\nEach round, a new player takes the monster controller tile and is responsible for controlling the monster that turn. The monster controller tile moves clockwise at the start of every round.\n\nMonster Controller Bonus.\nWhen a monster controller's survivor is selected as the monster's target, this foolhardy action earns that player's survivor +1 insanity. If the monster controller controls more than one survivor, make sure to nominate a different survivor each time you take the monster controller tile, cycling through all possible survivors.\n\nMonster Turn.\nA monster's turn proceeds in the following order:\nStart Turn\nDraw AI\nEnd Turn\n\nStart Turn\nSome AI cards and persistent injuries have rules that are performed at the start of the monster's turn. Make sure to perform them before drawing an Ai card. If there are multiple instances, the monster controller decides the order in which to perform them.\n\nDraw Ai\nThe monster controller draws the top AI card on the monster's AI deck and plays it. If there are no cards in the AI deck, shuffle the discard pile, create a new AI deck, and draw the top card.\n\nIf the monster does not have any cards in either its AI deck or its AI discard pile, it will perform its Basic Action (listed on the monster Basic Action / Reference Card) instead of drawing AI cards until it is defeated.\n\nEnd Turn\nSome AI cards and persistent injuries have rules that are performed at the end of the monster's turn. If there are multiple instances, the monster controller decides the order in which to perform them. Once these are resolved, the monster's turn comes to an end and the round continues.\n\nPlaying AI Cards.\nAfter drawing an AI card, the monster controller should read the card in its entirety, then perform all the actions on the card. AI cards consist of actions, flows, alerts, and persistent injuries. Perform each action before moving to the next. Some cards may only have one action. Some AI actions are conditional. If the conditions are met, perform the action. Otherwise, continue to the next action. If there are no further actions on a card, the card is resolved. Discard the AI card by placing it face up on the monster control panel in the discard pile. Then, continue the round.\n\nPersistent Injuries.\nPersistent injuries are conditional actions that replace the normal rules of an AI card. If a persistent injury action is performed, ignore any other actions on the card.\n\nPersistent injury actions are only performed when the monster draws an AI card with a persistent injury action that matches a persistent injury on a hit location in play.\n\nPlaying Moods & Traits.\nMoods & Traits have persistent effects over multiple rounds. These cards may change a monster's behavior and/or actions as play continues. Apply any persistent rules as long as the card remains in play (any time after it is drawn and before it is discarded). Perform any conditional actions as their conditions are met.\n\nIf an AI card contains an action to \"draw ,\" complete any applicable actions on the current AI card before drawing and playing a new AI card.\n\nPick Target.\nMonsters choose their target based on a Pick Target list or diagram at the top of each AI card.\n\nA Pick Target list is made of a series of conditions. Each may include several terms that create a single condition (e.g. knocked down survivor, in range). Start with the first condition. The monster controller should check if the conditions for targeting can be met. If not, move to the next condition and so on. Stop when a target condition is met.\n\nIn some cases, the target is determined by an area or zone, such as adjacent survivors or all survivor in a zone described by a diagram. These AI cards will illustrate or clearly state the area of the board that determines the target. The dark gray box represents the monster and its current facing.\n\nIn some cases, more than one target may be picked. Each AI card will specify if multiple survivors can be targeted by that AI card.\n\nThe last condition on the targeting list is no target. When this is reached, instead of performing any other action on the card, discard it and perform the indicated no target action or rule. This is most often the monster's instinct.\n\nA target may not be changed once the target is chosen.\n\nOften, multiple survivors will satisfy a targeting rule. For instance, multiple survivors might be considered closest. In these cases, the monster controller decided which survivor becomes the target. Monster controllers can use their decisions to give the advantage to the monster or to the group, or approach each decision randomly.\n\nSome attacks have collateral damage that effect survivors in a zone. In these cases, these survivors are not targets unless stated otherwise.\n\nCommon Targeting Terms.\nFacing: A monster is facing all spaces on the board that are in front of the miniature.\nIn Field of View: A survivor is always in a monster's field of view, unless they are in the monster's blind spot or the monster's line of sight is blocked. Only terrain with the Obstacle rule blocks field of view. See Also: Terrain.\nIn Range: A survivor is in range of a monster if the number of spaces between them is less than or equal to its current movement (including modifiers). If 'in range' is followed by a number, such as 'range (8)', that number replaces the monster's movement when calculating to see if a survivor is in range.\nRandom Survivor: The monster controller should randomly pick a survivor. Use dice, names in a hat, or any other preferred method.\nThreat: A threat is a survivor that is not knocked down or using special gear/terrain to prevent being considered a threat.\nClosest Survivor/Threat: The survivor/threat fewest spaces from the monster\nLast to Wound:The last survivor to wound the monster.\nNon-deaf Survivor:Survivors not suffering from the deaf severe injury.\nMost/Least: Zero can count as most or least unless otherwise stated (e.g. Survivor with the most Bleeding Tokens).\n\nPriority Target Token.\nIf a survivor gains the priority target token, that survivor captures the monster's attention. Only one survivor may have the priority target token at a time and they will gain it, even if another survivor already has it.\n\nWhen a monster performs a Pick Target action on an AI or card, ignore all other targeting conditions and target the survivor with the priority target token. When the survivor is picked as a target, they discard the priority target token. That survivor is now the target and after the attack the monster will lose its special interest in them. The priority target token does not affect AI cards that pick multiple targets or all survivors, nor any targeting on monster AI cards outside of a Pick Target action (e.g. the White Lion's Cunning card). The priority target token does not affect targeting in a monster's hit location deck. If a monster's reaction on a hit location card targets the attacker, the priority target token has no effect.\n\nMove & Attack Target Actions.\nMove & Attack Target actions are the most common way a monster will attack survivors. Move & Attack Target, unless specifically stated otherwise, is an instruction to move the monster towards its target up to its current movement or until adjacent, turn to face them, and attack using the action's attack profile. If a monster is already adjacent to its target, it will turn to face its target and attack without moving.\n\nSome actions simply state to full move towards the target, the attack target. This is effectively the same as Move & Attack Target.\n\nVariants of Move & Attack Target.\nOther actions, such as Materialize & Attack Target, or Move and Intimidate Target, are performed similarly to Move & Attack Target, but with rules of another behavior substituting for a portion of the action. Some attack profiles will only be preceded by an instruction to attack target. One these profiles, the monster does not move before attacking. \n\nMonster Movement.\nActions will dictate when to move the monster. Most commonly, this will be in the form of a Move & Attack Target action after a monster has picked a target. When an action instructs a monster to move toward a target, the monster controller must identify the shortest path between the monster and the target, then move the monster miniature along that path until it is adjacent to the target, or has no movement remaining. If there are multiple paths tied for the shortest, the monster controller chooses one. Regardless of their size, monsters move 1 space at a time in a cardinal direction (not diagonal).\n\nAfter moving the monster, turn to face the survivor, resolve any instances of collision then attack the target using the card's attack profile.\n\nSome attacks have reach or range. In these cases, move the monster the minimum number of spaces it must move to attack its target.\n\nFull Move.\nFull move is a term that describes a monster or survivor's maximum available movement, taking into account any positive or negative movement modifier token.\n\nForward, Back, Away, and Toward.\nSome actions and rules will specify a direction for the monster to move.\nForward: This is the direction the monster is currently facing.\nBack: This is the opposite direction the monster is currently facing.\nAway: This is usually in conjunction with something on the board (e.g., all survivors, the attacker, a board edge, a terrain tile). The monster controller should move as directly as possible, in any direction that puts the most spaces between the monster and the specified location.\nToward: This is usually in conjunction with something on the board. The monster controller should move as directly as possible, in the direction that moves the monster closest to the specified location.\n\nHow Monsters Attack.\nAttack actions direct a monster to attack. The second portion of a Move & Attack Target action tells a monster to attack its target. Attack actions are followed by attack profiles. Attack profiles on AI cards list the 3 basic components of an attack: speed (how many dice in the attack), accuracy (the likelihood of hitting), and damage (how much damage a hit causes). The monster controller makes an attack roll equal to the monster's speed, determines a hit location for each successful hit and deals damage.\n\nSpeed: The number of attack rolls. Speed is determined by the speed listed on the attack profile and modified by the monster's speed (listed on the monster's story event) and any speed modifier tokens. The monster controller rolls a numver of d10s equal to the speed of the attack.\n\nE.g. When a Level 1 White Lion attacks Zachary with Vicious Claw, the attack speed is listed as 2. The level 1 White Lion has no additional speed, so the monster controller rolls 2d10.\n\nAccuracy: The number to meet or exceed on an attack roll result for an attack to hit the target. Accuracy is determined by the accuracy listed on the attack profile, any accuracy modifiers tokens the monster has, and the evasion of the target.\n\nAttack Roll + Monster Accuracy Modifier must meet or exceed Attack Profile's Accuracy + Survivor's Evasion Modifier\n\nE.g. The monster controller rolles 2d10 to attack Zachary with Viscious Claw. If the roll results are 1 and 4, one attack roll hits (4) and one misses (1).\n\nDamage: An attack's target suffers the amount of damage listed on an attack profile, modified by the monster's damage attribute and any damage tokens. Damage from a single hit is applied to a single hit location.\n\nE.g. The Level 1 White Lion's Viscious Claw hit Zachary once. Since the damage listed on the attack profile is 1 and the Level 1 White Lion has no additional damage modifiers, the damage dealt from this hit is 1.\n\nDetermine Hit Locations.\nAfter the number of hits in an attack have been determined, the monster controller rolls the hit location dice once for every hit. Once all the rolls are made, resolve damage from each hit one at a time in the order the target chooses. If there is more than one hit, it is possible that the location dice will roll the same location more than once. Each hit location is resolved seperately.\n\nE.g. The monster controller rolls the hit location die to determine where the Vicious Claw attack lands. The result is waist. Zachary, like all starting survivors, has a Cloth gear that gives his waist 1 armor point. 1 damage to this location reduces the armor by 1 to 0.\n\nDeal Damage to Hit Locations.\n\nList of Showdowns.\nCore Game Showdowns.\nShowdown: White Lion\nShowdown: Screaming Antelope\nShowdown: Phoenix\nShowdown: Butcher\nShowdown: King's Man\nShowdown: The Hand\nShowdown: Watcher\nShowdown: Gold Smoke Knight\nLegendary Monsters\nExpansion Showdowns.\nDeath of the Dragon King\nThe Great Devourer\nSecret Meeting\nShowdown: Dragon King\nShowdown: Dung Beetle Knight\nShowdown: Flower Knight\nShowdown: Gorm\nShowdown: Lion God\nShowdown: Lion Knight\nShowdown: Lonely Tree\nShowdown: Manhunter\nShowdown: Slenderman\nShowdown: Spidicules\nShowdown: Sunstalker\nShowdown: Tyrant\nBeta Scenario Showdowns.\nAllison the Twilight Knight\nCandy & Cola\nAdam & Anna Explorers of Death\nPaul the Survivor\nKara Black\nThe Messenger of the First Story\nAya the Survivor\nThe Messenger of Courage\nThe Messenger of Humanity\nThe Messenger of the Spiral Path\nSnow the Savior",

      "definition": "Synchronic Attacks are powerful actions that simultaneously affect all survivors in a zone. To perform a Synchronic Attack, the monster controller examines the zone, noting all survivors that are within it, and makes a single set of attack rolls. Apply the roll results of these attack rolls to all survivors within the zone. A survivor's evasion, dodge, block, deflect, and gear apply to that survivor only when determining hits.\n\nEx. A level 2 Crimson Crocodile draws 21,000 Newton Bite. Allister, Zachary, and Erza are all in the Synchronic Attack zone. With a speed of 3, the monster rolls a single set of attacks, rolling 3, 5, and 8. Allister, Zachary, and Erza must now individually calculate how many hits they suffer. Allister has an evasion of 2, so the 3 misses and he is hit twice. Erza and Zachary do not have any evasion, but Erza has 2 deflect tokens. She uses them and suffers a single hit. Zachary suffers all 3 hits.\n\nAfter hits are determined, the monster controller selects a hit survivor and resolves the rest of the attack, rolling hit location dice, dealing damage, and triggering effects before moving onto the next hit survivor. Once all hits are resolved, the action ends, and the next action on the card can be performed. \n\nAttack Effects.\nAttack effects trigger for each survivor individually as the monster controller resolves the rest of the attack one survivor at a time.\n\nMove & Synchronic Attack Target.\nThe monster controller must identify the shortest path until the target is in the attack zone. If this is not possible and the Synchronic Attack cannot reach the target, the monster will still perform the Synchronic Attack if there are other survivors in the attack zone. \n\nMove & Attack (Specific Space) Target.\nWhen a Synchronic Attack zone specifies highlighted spaces, the monster controller must try to move the monster until the target is in the highlighted space. \n\nIf the target cannot be in the highlighted space, the monster controller must try to move the monster so the target is in the attack zone. If that is not possible, the monster will move as close to the target as possible. The monster will still perform the Synchronic Attack if there are survivors in the attack zone.",

Unless otherwise stated, survivors may move through spaces with terrain tiles on them as if they were unoccupied spaces. Terrain tiles may not be placed on top of one or another. Ignore any rules or effects that instruct you to place more terrain tiles than are available.\n\nThe Terrain & Deployment section of each monster's showdown story event specifies what terrain to use for that showdown.\n\nTerrain Cards.\nTerrain cards correspond with their matching tiles. and contain rules for place and interacting with them. They are placed on the side of the showdown board so they can be easily referenced.\n\nSurvivors and Terrain.\nTerrain cards with indicat the corresponding terrain can be activated. Survivors adjacent to or on spaces occupied by this kind of terrain may spend activation to use the rules listed on the terrain card.\n\nTerrain cards can have persistent rules that affect survivors during the showdown. Including:\nObstacle: This blocks survivor and monster field of view. It interrupts ranged weapon attacks and monster targeting.\n\nTo check if the field of view is blocked, draw an imaginary line from the center of the miniature's base to the center of the intended target's base. If the line comes in contact with a space occupied by an obstacle, then the field of view is blocked, and the target is not in the field of view.\n\nImpassable: Impassable terrain occupies all spaces that it covers. Survivors cannot move through spacves occupied by impassable terrain. If a survivor would move (voluntarily or involuntarily) into a space occupier by impassable terrain, they instead collide with the terrain and end their movement.\n\nIf a monster rule (like Grab) would place a survivor onto impassable terrain, they instead collide with the terrain and are moved to the nearest free space adjacent to the terrain. \n\nDestructible: When a survivor collies with destructible terrain, archive the terrain tile. The survivor suffers 1 damage to a random hit location as a result of the collision.\n\nMonsters and Terrain.\nUnless stated otherwise on the terrain card, monsters ignore terrain times on the showdown board.",

Crossovers and Pinups listed together, as both \"series\" are non-canon to the world of KDM? This line of thinking makes me think these series should all be seperated.\nI've been going back and forth on that, but there is an important distinction between them. All Death High models have been limited release, but not all limited release models are Death High, for example. I'm in favor of having separate pages for them.--BoxDroppingManApe (talk) 17:59, October 10, 2019 (UTC)\nWhen using the template we need to be careful of things being listed like the page themselves, if that makes sense? Should we have a proper bullet list that just links normally to each individual article, rather than a link to the category?\nThe category list template is dynamic, so it'll automatically update as new cards are added to categories, that way we don't have to worry as much about the proper bulleted lists becoming out of date. If there are categories that are unlikely to change (such as Starting Gear or something), those might be good candidates for manually writing out the list. As for your first point, do you have an example where that has happened? That shouldn't happen if things are working right. --BoxDroppingManApe (talk) 17:59, October 10, 2019 (UTC)\nCreate a secondary wiki to showcase CCG homebrew content, with a link on the front page of the KDM wiki?\nAssume ownership of the two competing KDM wikis to scrub them from the internet?\nIncorporate CE content into wiki?\n\nQuestions.\nWho did the monster programming for the Screaming Antelope?\nWho did the concept artwork for the Screaming Antelope?\nWho did the sculpting for the Screaming Antelope?",
