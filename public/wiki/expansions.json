      "definition": "Lore.\nThe Abyssal Woods exists on the precipice of obliteration, its heavy limbs pulled inexorably towards a black hole at its center, no larger than a grain of sand. The hole breathes, as though it were a living being. Every inhale threatens to devour the forest, an intense vacuum rips roots from the ground and sucks waves of tumbling debris through the air. \n\nEverything that lives in the Abyssal Woods evolves to survive the tantrums of a tiny, unpredictable orifice at its center. Insects with opposable thumbs cling tenaciously to trees, whose roots have become powerful, gnarled hands firmly gripping the ground. Seasoned visitors carry chains and hooks to secure themselves at a moment's notice to the largest things in sight when the winds pick up.\n\nThe Flower Witch flickers through the woods, tending to inscrutable tasks that keep it from swallowing itself. Her seemingly random alterations create wonder and death for foolhardy travelers. A coven of disciples assists in the care of the Abyssal Woods; clearing trails, calming boiling rivers, balancing bacterial colonies, and most importantly, clearing the clots from the infinity web that encloses the vacuum at the heart of the forest.Kingdom Death Store Descriptions for Flower Witch and Disciples of the Witch, Recorded on Vibrant Lantern (Kingdom Death store page no longer exists)\n\nGameplay.\nSurvivors visit the Abyssal Woods when hunting the Flower Knight or Spidicules monsters, although it appears to be a more tame section of the Abyssal Woods, as the survivors don't have to deal with the vacuum at the center of the woods. These two expansions will be required expansions for the Abyssal Woods expansion, while the Dung Beetle Knight and Honeycomb Weaver will have optional interactions with the expansion.\n\nThe Abyssal Woods expansion was announced during the Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Kickstarter.Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Kickstarter, Update #40 The Abyssal Woods was originally teased with the release of the Flower Witch and the Disciples of the Witch models on the Kingdom Death store. The update also shows the Dragon Goblin to perhaps be the main showdown monster of the campaign.\n\nReferences.",

It remains alone, clinging to the memories of its once mighty race. Its destructive moods swing wildly from impotent rage to obsessive nostalgia. It stalks the darkness, lashing out at anything it meets. Survivors that run across the moody monster usually fall prey to the unseen waves of ruinous pain that emanate from the monster's glowing heart.

This delicacy was impossible to reach because the Phoenix's domain was fiercely guarded by the Flower Knight and the beetles presented a threat to the natural balance the Flower Knight protects. Over countless generations, the insects evolved into the likeness of a hulking knight to avoid the Flower Knight which sees no threat from feeble humans. Clever and hungry, it savagely hunts for nourishment to fill its massive ball, which also serves as a repulsive weapon.\nLimited Release Description\n\nResourceful and hungry, this cunning species has evolved a knight's shape to fool booth predators and prey. It rolls a massive resin ball formed from spit used to collect rare feces for its meals.\n\nThe Dung Beetle Knight is an extremely difficult foe. You will find that a little preparation goes a long way. The Rumbling in the Dark innovation will offer your settlement the opportunity to train before they face the Dung Beetle Knight.
