It features content that integrates with the core game.\n\nStore Description.\nThe Swashbuckler is the result of a collaboration between Adam & Lokman, exploring some well established tropes in fantasy art. Originally intended as a small line of Generic Hero Classes, the results were so compelling and un-generic, each hero's appearance told so many exciting stories that we wanted to integrate them into the KD world but so far nothing concrete has emerged.\n\nPlundering indiscriminately, the swashbuckler's crippling kleptomania keeps her ship barely bobbing over the surface of the waves. Lost at sea as a child, she spent years surviving alone on a deserted island. Scavenging for scraps to eke out a meager existence she pathologically finds need to ransack her victims for strange odds and ends.\n\nHer fate took a turn when she boarded a cursed galleon, stealing a coat of otherworldly splendor. The coat, armed with spectral pistols fires at random, often causing violent accidents and winning her no friends.\n\nContents.\n1x Hard plastic miniature\n1x Hard plastic 30mm round base with unique insert\n1x Corsair Coat rare gear card\nLarge matte print of the original concept artwork on heavy card stock\n\nNotes.\nThis is currently the only miniature in the Generic line that features content that integrates with Kingdom Death: Monster.\n\nSB1.jpg\nSB2.jpg\nSB3.jpg\nSB4.jpg\nSB5.jpg\nSB6.jpg",
