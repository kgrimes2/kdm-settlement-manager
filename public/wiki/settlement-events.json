      "definition": "is a settlement event card found in the Kingdom Death: Monster Core Game.\nCard Text.\nIf you are the only player, a survivor dreams about a giant man that controls their lives from the darkness above. All departing survivors gain +3 insanity.\n\nOtherwise...\n\nThe group must select a player to be the storyteller and a survivor to be the dreamer. The dreamer has a weird dream and the storyteller must tell the rest of the group all about it. The remaining players will vote to determine if the dream was well told and then consult the crowd reaction below.\n\nWell Told - A truly amazing tale! The settlement is inspired and gains +1d5 Endeavors.\n\nPoorly Told - The settlement boos and heckles the dreamer. Add the Nickname settlement event to the timeline next year and nominate the dreamer for it. Nominate 3 other survivors. Having a great laugh, they gain survival up to the current survival limit if they depart this year. The storyteller may not play as one of these survivors for the next hunt and showdown.\n\nThe selected player rolls 1d10 on each of the following tables to determine what the survivor's weird dream was about. The player should try their best to weave a compelling story to share with the other players and the settlement.\n\n----\n\n----\n\nTriggered by.",
