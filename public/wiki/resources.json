The event revealer rolls 1d10 and adds their movement to their roll.\n\nIf any survivor has the Strategist fighting art, they may corner the Gregalope at a giant stone face instead of giving chase. If they do, end the hunt immediately. Start a showdown with a level 2 Screaming Antelope, using its setup rules.
