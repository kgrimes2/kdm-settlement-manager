      "definition": "Lore.\nThe Abyssal Woods exists on the precipice of obliteration, its heavy limbs pulled inexorably towards a black hole at its center, no larger than a grain of sand. The hole breathes, as though it were a living being. Every inhale threatens to devour the forest, an intense vacuum rips roots from the ground and sucks waves of tumbling debris through the air. \n\nEverything that lives in the Abyssal Woods evolves to survive the tantrums of a tiny, unpredictable orifice at its center. Insects with opposable thumbs cling tenaciously to trees, whose roots have become powerful, gnarled hands firmly gripping the ground. Seasoned visitors carry chains and hooks to secure themselves at a moment's notice to the largest things in sight when the winds pick up.\n\nThe Flower Witch flickers through the woods, tending to inscrutable tasks that keep it from swallowing itself. Her seemingly random alterations create wonder and death for foolhardy travelers. A coven of disciples assists in the care of the Abyssal Woods; clearing trails, calming boiling rivers, balancing bacterial colonies, and most importantly, clearing the clots from the infinity web that encloses the vacuum at the heart of the forest.Kingdom Death Store Descriptions for Flower Witch and Disciples of the Witch, Recorded on Vibrant Lantern\n\nGameplay.\nSurvivors visit the Abyssal Woods when hunting the Flower Knight or Spidicules monsters, although it appears to be a more tame section of the Abyssal Woods, as the survivors don't have to deal with the vacuum at the center of the woods. These two expansions will be required expansions for the Abyssal Woods expansion, while the Dung Beetle Knight and Honeycomb Weaver will have optional interactions with the expansion.\n\nThe Abyssal Woods expansion was announced during the Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Kickstarter.Kingdom Death: Monster 1.5 Kickstarter, Update #40 The Abyssal Woods was originally teased with the release of the Flower Witch and the Disciples of the Witch models on the Kingdom Death store. The update also shows the Dragon Goblin to perhaps be the main showdown monster of the campaign.\n\nReferences.",

      "definition": "Arc survivors awaken with their minds unshackled. Three interconnected components represent their faculties: Philosophy, Knowledge, and Collective Cognition.\n\nPhilosophies are the way arc survivors make sense of their experiences. When they come of age, arc survivors adopt a philosophy that guides how they grow and change in response to their nightmare existence.\n\nKnowledges are skills that can be learned and taught. Often they arise from insight gleaned from an arc survivor's philosophy. Arc survivors' intellectual capacity allows these skills to evolve with experience and to benefit the settlement beyond one survivor's lifetime.\n\nCollective Cognition is the growing potential of a settlement that comes from the neurological benefits of a diverse and nutritious diet.\n\nThese three elements build on one another to create a unique experience for arc survivors. Collective Cognition generates new philosophies that add new knowledges. Arc survivors are an optional component; they can be added to any campaign.\n\nAdding Arc Survivors.\nTo add arc survivors to a new campaign, use the arc survivor settlement and survivor record sheets.\n\nAdd First Meal to lantern year 1 of the timeline on the arc settlement record sheet.\nReplace Principle: Romantic with Principle: Romantic (Arc) and Sculpture with Sculpture (Arc).\nReplace 1 basic hunt event card with Arc Survivor Hunt Event in the basic hunt event deck.\nReplace Murder with Murder (Arc) and Skull Eater with Skull Eater (Arc) in the settlement event deck.\nUse Intimacy (Arc) instead of Intimacy (Story Event).\nDuring the settlement phase, use the arc survivor settlement board to hold new arc survivor decks.\n\nCurrent Campaign.\nArc survivors introduce significant changes to your settlement and gameplay. They cannot be added mid-campaign.\n\nPeople of the Dream Keeper.\nOnly arc survivors live in The Gambler's settlement. The People of the Dream Keeper campaign uses many of the new components in the Gambler's Chest Expansion, including arc survivors. Complete rules for the setting up the campaign are in the People of the Dream Keeper Campaign section.\n\nArc Survivors Are Different.\nThe lives of arc survivors are packed with new aptitudes and their difficult consequences. Arc survivors do not age like other survivors; instead their development is shaped by their philosophies. These new-found freedoms and stresses are represented by new attributes.\n\nArc Survivor Attributes.\nSystemic Pressure: A manifestation of physical stress that accumulates. When survivors make a severe injury roll, subtract their systemic pressure from the roll result.\n\nTorment: A manifestation of ongoing mental strain that accumulates. When survivors make a brain trauma roll, subtract their torment from the roll result.\n\nTorment and systemic pressure are cumulative like other attributes. If a survivor has 1 torment and then gains +1 torment, they then have 2 torment. Arc survivors' knowledges and neuroses can also persistently alter these attributes. If they are removed, their effects on torment and systemic pressure are also removed.\n\nLumi.\nLumi is the spark of curiosity that proliferates knowledge. Lumi is accrued and spent like survival.\n\nArc Survivors Age Differently.\nPhilosophies replace the Age story event that other survivors trigger as they develop. Although arc survivors still get older, the way they change with age is determined by their philosophy.\n\nArc Survivors and Weapon Proficiency.\nArc survivors do not choose weapon proficiencies as a result of the Age story event. Instead, weapon proficiencies result from collective cognition rewards.\n\nThe Forum Settlement Location.\nAs their collective cognition increases, arc survivors earn a Forum location in their settlements. The Forum is dedicated to knowledge. At the Forum, survivors learn and share knowledges and help others along their philosophical journeys.",

Originally intended as a small line of Generic Hero Classes, the results were so compelling and un-generic, each hero's appearance told so many exciting stories that we wanted to integrate them into the KD world but so far nothing concrete has emerged. \n\nShe always heard stories of how her older sister left home on the day of her birth to be initiated into the stoic sect of the Azure knights. These fighters emanated the invigored breeze of hope for her people who live shrouded in otherwise darkness and stagnant air. Throughout childhood she made sure to follow the Azure Knight's code, showing unwavering grace and civility to all those around her.\n\nOn the day her sister’s sword was brought back home by a mysterious messenger, she decided it was time, no matter how young she may be, to discover what happened to her estranged sibling. Under the cover of night she stole the heavy blade. The sword of the Azure Knights was known to cut through any shadow with a sharp gust of vehemence and might. Instilling in it’s wielder a clear, blue vision of their future victory against the dankest of adversaries. With scraps of cloth and bones of animals salvaged near her family’s home she sewed herself the uniform of the Azure Knights and departed on the the same path her sister took so many years ago. In search of an answer in the dark.\n\nContents.\n1 x Resin Azure Knight\n1 x Hard Plastic Kingdom Death 30mm round base & insert\nLarge matte print of the original concept artwork on heavy card stock\nCharacter art card\n\nAzure-Fighter-for-store-1_900x.jpg\nAzure-Fighter-for-store-2_900x.jpg\nAzure-Fighter-for-store-3_900x.jpg\nAzure-Fighter-for-store-4_900x.jpg",

Arc survivors live to enrich their diets, and in return, their well-nourished brains can collectively achieve new heights of power and sophistication.\n\nThis cultural growth is represented by collective cognition (CC). As the settlement reaches higher amounts of CC, they earn rewards.\n\nSurvivors acquire collective cognition by defeating a mix of challenging monsters. More challenging monsters proffer greater collective cognition.\n\nGaining CC from Quarry Monsters.\nQuarry monsters stalking the darkness offer a powerful incentive for hungry arc survivors. Older, tougher monsters are a feast for ravenous arc cells. If they defeat a monster, the victorious survivors return to the settlement with food and the potential for profound change. Victorious survivors gain CC in the Aftermath of the Showdown. Once the Aftermath is resolved, update the Settlement Victories section on the arc settlement record sheet. Next to the name of the defeated quarry, fill an unfilled box under its level. Update the total collective cognition above. If no box remains unfilled for that monster's level, the settlement gains no CC.\n\nLv. 1 quarry monsters provide 1 CC the first time they are defeated.\nLv. 2 quarry monsters provide 2 CC the first 2 times they are defeated.\nLv. 3+ quarry monsters provide 3 CC the first 3 times they are defeated.\n\nGaining CC from Nemesis Monsters.\nMenacing forces invading the settlement do not provide the same kinds of enrichment. They contribute to the collective cognition (3 CC) only the first time each level is defeated. Defeating the same level nemesis multiple times generates no additional CC.\n\nLegendary Monsters.\nLegendary monsters are singular existences that are not standard quarry monsters. The settlement gains 3 CC after defeating one.\n\nCollective Cognition Rewards.\nWhen a settlement eats well, its collective cognition increases. This can add new cultural benefits for arc survivors, which are found on CC Reward cards.\n\nCC Reward Cards.\nCC Reward cards are gained when the settlement reaches a specific amount of collective cognition.\n\nThe back of each CC Reward card has a number indicating the collective cognition needed to gain the card. The front of each card contains the rules for gaining the reward.\n\nQuarry Monster CC Rewards.\nQuarry monster rewards have a collective cognition number corresponding to their node. The node represents the order these quarry monsters appear in the story of your campaign.\n\nCreate the CC Rewards Deck.\nOrganize all CC Rewards cards according to the numbers on the backs, from lowest to highest, so that the lowest number is on top of the deck, face down.\n\nInclude only the quarry monster reward cards for monsters in your campaign. Examine cards 6, 16, 26 and 36.\n\nFor the People of the Dream Keeper campaign, include the Crimson Crocodile, Smog Singers, Phoenix, and King. Set the other monster CC Rewards aside.\n\nUnique CC Rewards.\nThere can never be more than one card with the same collective cognition number in the deck. In cases where duplicates remain, choose one.\n\nRecord CC Rewards.\nOnce your deck is complete, record the name of each CC Reward in the space provided on the arc settlement record sheet in numerical order.\n\nGaining CC Rewards.\nThe settlement gains collective cognition rewards during the Check Milestones step of the settlement phase. Compare the collective cognition total to the top card of the CC Rewards deck. The settlement gains any cards with numbers less than or equal to the settlement's collective cognition.\n\nFor each CC reward gained, follow the rules listed on the card and update the settlement accordingly. Find the reward listed in the Collective Cognition Rewards section of the arc settlement record sheet; fill in the box next to the reward and archive the CC Reward card.\n\nFood Innovations.\nOne reward of improving collective cognition is innovations of the preparation and culture of food. The only way to gain these innovations is through achieving higher collective cognition. When they reach the pinnacle of food innovation, Supreme Cuisine, they can Endeavor to create meal gear.\n\nButchery and Arc Survivor Weapon Proficiency.\nArc survivors cannot select a Weapon Proficiency until they have gained the Butchery food innovation. Once earned, they may select a weapon proficiency when they depart for a hunt.\n\nMeal Gear.\nDevouring quarries inspires the survivors to craft marvelous recipes. If the settlement has earned at least 10 CC from consuming a quarry, they may endeavor at Supreme Cuisine to craft that monster's meal.\n\nOnce a meal is crafted, it can be used by the settlement each lantern year. A survivor may place one meal in their Gear Grid, gaining the monster-inspired effects when they Depart the settlement. A settlement may only have one of each meal gear at any time.",

      "definition": "Something is hunting the survivors as they hunt their quarry. Encounters with these foes take place during the hunt phase. Encounters can ruin or enrich a hunt. The Gambler's Chest Expansion includes the Bone Eaters encounter monsters.\n\nEncounter Monster Components.\nThe following components are used for an encounter with the dangerous Bone Eaters:\n\nEncounter hunt event cards\nInitiative cards\nOpportunity deck\nCounter deck\nCritical wound deck\nEncounter Showdown story event\nReference card\nEncounter board\nEncounter monster miniatures\nLife dice\n\nAdding Encounters.\nTo add encounters to a new campaign, add each encounter's introduction story event to the indicated lantern year on the timeline of your settlement record sheet.\n\nCurrent Campaign.\nTo add encounters to a current campaign, add each encounter's introduction story event to the indicated lantern year on the timeline of your settlement record sheet. If this lantern year has passed, add it to the next lantern year.\n\nAdding Bone Eaters.\nAdd the introduction story event Missing Statue to lantern year 3 on the settlement's timeline.\n\nEncounter hunt event cards replace basic hunt event cards, introducing the looming threat of an encounter showdown during the hunt.\n\nInitiative cards determine the order in which the monsters act. Each initiative card is illustrated with a specific encounter monster.\n\nOpportunity cards are small cards that add horrifying outcomes to encounter monster basic attacks.\n\nCounter cards are small cards that describe counter measures performed by monsters when they find an opening.\n\nCritical wound cards are small cards that describe what happens when survivors inflict critical wounds on encounter monsters.\n\nThe Encounter Showdown story event lists the monsters' attributes and traits, encounter setup diagrams, and the outcomes of the encounter.\n\nReference cards list essential information that the monster controller uses to pummel the survivors.\n\nThe encounter board is a unique board on which encounter showdowns take place.\n\nLife dice are used to track each monster's life total.\n\nThere are five Bone Eater miniatures in this expansion. Survivors will battle all of them at once.\n\nEncounter Hunt Events.\nWhen the encounter monster introduction story event is triggered, an encounter hunt event card is introduced into the basic hunt event deck. From this moment, the threat of an encounter looms over every hunt.\n\nMissing Statue replaces a basic hunt event with Bone Eaters - Encounter Level 1 in the basic hunt event deck.\n\nWhen the encounter hunt event is revealed, if the current lantern year is the same or later than the lantern year on the card, the encounter monsters challenge the survivors and the encounter showdown begins. If the lantern year on the card is in the settlement's future, the monsters are disinterested; roll a random hunt event instead.\n\nEncounter Showdown.\nEncounters take place in the claustrophobic darkness of the hunt, somewhere between the settlement and the survivors' quarry.\n\nEncounter Board Setup.\nSet up the small encounter board below the hunt board. Leave all hunt phase materials (e.g., hunt board, unrevealed hunt events) on the table.\n\nTurn to the Encounter Showdown story event. Place the terrain, the monsters, and the survivors as specified by the encounter setup diagram for your encounter level.\n\nPlace life dice showing the starting life of each encounter monster in that monster's base.\n\nDo not add terrain tiles beyond what is listed in the encounter setup (ignore the effects of Strategist, Bug Trap, etc.).\n\nSet Up Encounter Cards.\nEncounter showdown story events list the monsters' attributes and traits for each encounter level.\n\nPlace any Special trait cards listed for your encounter level faceup in play alongside the encounter board.\n\nPlace the double-sided Basic Action / Reference card and initiative cards nearby. Shuffle the basic resource deck and set it facedown.\n\nShuffle each deck of opportunity, counter, and critical wound cards and set each nearby. These cards, along with Basic Actions and traits, determine the monsters' behaviors.\n\nThe Encounter.\nEncounters are showdowns and have the same round structure. The rules in this section highlight the differences between encounters and showdowns. If questions arise, consult the Showdown Phase section in the core game rulebook.\n\nAt the beginning of an encounter, survivors gain Arrival and \"start of showdown\" bonuses. Effects that directly refer to the showdown, such as \"during the showdown\" effects, are usable during an encounter. All showdowns are unique conflicts, so \"once per showdown\" effects may be used again during the showdown with the survivors' quarry.\n\nMonster Turn.\nAll encounter monsters act on the monster turn. At the start of the monster turn, the monster controller shuffles the initiative cards.\n\nInitiative Cards.\nThe order in which encounter monsters act is determined by initiative cards. The monster controller draws the top initiative card, activating the monster shown. This monster performs its Basic Action. Do this until all monsters have been activated and their turns resolved.\n\nEncounter Monster Basic Action.\nEncounter monsters perform their Basic Action one at a time. As they do, they are always searching for an opportunity to get the upper hand. The monsters' Basic Action describes when such an opening occurs.\n\nThese opportunities are part of the Basic Action. They describe when the monster will draw an opportunity card. For example, Bone Eaters draw an opportunity card when they roll any Perfect hits.\n\nOpportunity Cards.\nWhen a monster draws an opportunity card, perform it as you would any other card. These are always performed by the currently acting monster and use the target of the Basic Action unless otherwise stated. When an opportunity card is resolved, place it in a discard pile.\n\nOpportunity Card Moods.\nSome opportunity cards are monster moods. These follow the same rules as showdown monster moods. Place them in play and apply their persistent rules for as long as the card remains in play. Opportunity moods affect all monsters unless otherwise stated.\n\nEncounter Monsters Are Individual Monsters.\nEach encounter monster is its own entity. When rules state that a monster gains an attribute token, only that monster gains a token. Encounter monsters do not share fields of view or adjacency.\n\nMovement & Collision.\n\nEncounter Monster Movement.\nWhen an action instructs an encounter monster to move towards a target, it takes the shortest path possible, moving around survivors, impassable terrain, and other monsters. If no path exists, move the monster as close as possible to its target.\n\nEncounter monsters cannot voluntarily move through spaces occupied by survivors, impassable terrain, or other monsters.\n\nIf an encounter monster would occupy a space containing impassable terrain or another monster, place it in the nearest unoccupied space instead.\n\nEncounter Monster Knockback.\nWhen an encounter monster suffers knockback, move it the indicated number of spaces away from the source of the knockback. If the monster would move into impassable terrain or another monster, stop its movement in the last unoccupied space before that object is reached (archive destructible terrain).\n\nKnockback can move an encounter monster through a survivor. When it does, the survivor suffers collision at the end of the monster's movement. If the monster ends its knockback on a space occupied by a survivor, the survivor suffers collision and knockback 5.\n\nSurvivor Turn.\nSurvivors can perform the same actions in an encounter that they perform in a showdown. Encounter monsters do not have hit location decks, but they may still suffer critical wounds.\n\nAttacking Encounter Monsters.\nSurvivors make attack rolls and determine the number of hits as normal.\n\nInstead of drawing hit location cards for each hit, survivors make a wound attempt roll for each hit, one at a time. On a successful wound attempt, the encounter monster suffers a wound.\n\nWhen a survivor attacks while multiple encounter monsters are in range, they must choose which encounter monster they are attacking. If an encounter monster moves out of range or dies mid-attack, cancel all remaining hits.\n\nCheck for Critical Wounds.\nLantern 10s, luck, and other applicable rules may cause critical wounds as normal.\n\nWhen the monster receives a critical wound, draw and resolve a critical wound card. If a survivor kills a monster with a critical wound, they still draw and resolve a critical wound card. After resolving it, place the critical wound card in a discard pile.\n\nWounding Encounter Monsters.\nWhen the encounter monster suffers a wound, reduce the monster's life by 1 (track this using the life dice on the model's base). If the monster's Life reaches 0, it dies. Remove its miniature from the encounter board and archive its initiative card.\n\nCounter Conditions and Counter Cards.\nEncounter monsters may counter the survivors' desperate assault. The counter conditions listed on the encounter monster reference card describe the moment this occurs.\n\nWhen the counter conditions occur, the monster controller draws a counter card and resolves it. After a counter card is resolved, place it in a discard pile.\n\nSurvival Opportunities.\nSurvivors have all the survival opportunities of a monster showdown: on the survivors' turn, during flows, after critical wounds, and when a monster is knocked down. The one exception is survival opportunities during reactions; without a hit location deck, these opportunities do not arise.\n\nWhen an encounter monster draws an opportunity or counter card, there are no survival opportunities unless a flow is present.\n\nEnd of the Encounter.\nAt the end of the encounter, the survivors are either defeated or have reached a crossroads. Since the end of the encounter is not the end of the journey, there is no Aftermath step.\n\nDefeat.\nIf the hunting party has perished, they suffer defeat. Resolve the rules of defeat on the encounter showdown story event and end your hunt. Continue to the settlement phase.\n\nVictory.\nWhen the survivors are victorious, they gain the listed benefits of victory and rewards. Once they have determined their rewards, they Deliberate their next steps. Survivors retain all tokens and damage accrued during the encounter. Instead of applying any Aftermath rules, they must make a choice:\n\nResume the hunt. The survivors press on into the darkness, resuming on the hunt board as though they had just resolved a long hunt event.\n\nReturn home. The settlement suffers. Place the survivors at Starvation. The hunt ends in failure.\n\nLower expectations. The survivors can elect to hunt a lower-level quarry. Do not adjust the survivors' or monster's positions on the hunt board. When the showdown begins, the survivors fight a monster one level lower than that of their original quarry. You cannot lower a monster's level to less than 1.\n\nIf an effect like Exhausted Lantern Hoard compels the survivors to hunt level 3+ monsters, they cannot choose to fight a monster below level 3.\n\nEncounters Intensify.\nOnce the encounter monster is defeated, remove the corresponding encounter hunt event card from the basic hunt event deck.\n\nIf possible, the threat intensifies. Add the next higher level encounter hunt event card to the deck. If none exists, the threat disappears back into the darkness.\n\nContinue the Hunt.\nIf the survivors choose to lower their expectations or resume the hunt, return the encounter materials to the game box. The hunt phase resumes.",

Unite to survive by hunting monsters and collectively guiding the development of your settlement through a 30 year, self-running campaign.\n\nEvery decision matters. A space moved during the showdown, every resource spent to craft a piece of gear, what principles your settlement upholds - all can have lasting impact on this highly replayable and challenging game. \n\nCampaign System\nEmbark alone or with up to 4 friends (6 with game variant) on a 30 lantern year campaign. Each lantern year will cycle through a chaotic hunt, a showdown with a monster, and the development of your settlement. With so much emphasis on player choice, no two campaign runs will be alike.\n\nMonster AI System\nYou will fight 8 monsters, each controlled by their own pair of decks that scale to 3 levels of difficulty. (Except for the final encounter, it has only 1 level and it's HARD!) Every encounter, even with the same monster, is diverse and valuable. No two showdowns will resolve the same way. Players will have to plan their gear and keep their minds sharp to prevail.\n\nGear System\nIn Monster, survivors will craft gear using resources earned from defeating monsters or found on their hunt. Each survivor has a gear grid, and can slot up to 9 pieces of gear at a time. What gear you will carry and how you arrange it can unlock advantages that may make the difference between life and death.\n\nStory Event System\nYou will encounter 40+ story events that will shape the story of your unique campaign. Your settlement's decisions and discoveries affect how the story events unfold. Story Events cover everything from setting up and fighting a monster to dramatic turning points in your settlements history. \nHistory.\n\nContents.\nGameplay.\n1x Hardcover rule book (11\" x 8.5\"

      "term": "Knowledge",
      "definition": "Knowledge card back/front, from Gambler's Chest Expansion.]]\nKnowledges are techniques for showdown, hunt, and settlement phases. Unlike Fighting Arts, knowledges can evolve with careful observation from a hazy idea into a powerful weapon.\n\nSurvivors learn knowledges from their Philosphies and at the Forum settlement location in the arc settlement. Rules for each knowledge are found on its corresponding knowledge card. Knowledge cards can be gained from the knowledge deck, the Forum, or added from the game box.\n\nKnowledge Cards.\nKnowledge cards have the rules for performing them, and observation conditions that describe how the knowledge might evolve. Not all knowledge evolves.\n\nName and Level: The name and level of the knowledge (indicated by a roman numeral).\nLumi Cost: Knowledge can be gained at the Forum settlement location for a lumi cost.\nKeywords: Knowledge cards have keywords that indicate information about the knowledge.\nCard Art: Unique, evocative art.\nRules: Rules for performing the knowledge.\nObservation Condition: Knowledge can improve with mindful practice. The observation conditions describes what must occur to make an observation.\nObservations: Boxes indicate how many times survivors must make an observation before a knowledge can level up.\nLevel Up: When a survivor completes all observations, the knowledge levels up in one of three ways.\n\nAdvance. Refinement reached with practice. Survivors replace the knowledge with the higher level version of the same knowledge. Erase the old knowledge and record the new one in its place. The old knowledge becomes obsolete.\n\nEpiphany. A novel discovery. The survivor gains a new knowledge that does not replace the old knowledge. It is possible for a survivor to replace the knowledge that gave birth to the epiphany if all their knowledge slots are full. However, the old knowledge remains in the settlement's knowledge deck.\n\nDangerous Observation. The consequences of hubris. Follow the rules listed here at the bottom of the card.\n\nRecording Knowledge.\nWhen a survivor gains a knowledge, they record its name (including its level, if it has one), rules, observation condition, and the number of observation boxes on their arc survivor record sheet.\n\nArc survivors have three knowledge slots: one slot for their tenet knowledge and two slots for any other knowledges.\n\nUsing Knowledge.\nSurvivors most often use their knowledge during showdowns. The rules on knowledges describe how and when to use them and any existing limits.\n\nKnowledge with a Theory.\nSome knowledge begins as an inkling of an idea too hazy to have an effect. Survivors must make enough observations to replace this knowledge with the next rank to benefit from their careful observations.\n\nKnowledge with Attributes.\nSome knowledges give survivors positive or negative attributes. Apply these effects to the survivor's attributes as long as they possess the knowledge. When this knowledge is removed or cannot be used, the attribute modifier no longer applies.\n\nKnowledge Deck.\nThe knowledge deck grows and shrinks as survivors obtain dizzying new heights of enlightenment.\n\nStarting Knowledge Deck.\nDuring the prologue, you will build your initial Knowledge deck of four knowledge cards with the starting keyword.\n\nThe Gambler's Chest Expansion contains four starting knowledge cards: Darkness I, Despair I, Fear I, Hunger I.\n\nGaining Knowledge.\nFor arc survivors, the consequences of gaining knowledge are profound. They are uniquely capable of transmitting and preserving knowledge. When one survivor makes strides, the whole settlement benefits. These benefits endure beyond the lifetime of the survivor who uncovers them.\n\nWhen a survivor gains knowledge, (e.g., Tenets, through their philosophy, as a result of observation at the Forum, etc.), they gain the highest level of that knowledge known in the settlement.\n\nCheck the Knowledge section of the arc settlement record sheet to confirm the highest level of this knowledge. The Knowledge section represents the sum of what is known in the settlement. If the survivor gained new knowledge from an observation or in game event, the whole settlement benefits from their discovery.\n\nNew Knowledge.\nIf the knowledge gained is new to the settlement, record it in the appropriate place on the arc survivor record sheet. Also add its name and level to the Knowledge section on the arc settlement record sheet. Finally, add the card to the knowledge deck.\n\nExisting Knowledge.\nWhen a survivor gains knowledge that is already known in the settlement, they gain the highest level any survivor has ever known. Check the Knowledge section of the campaign's Arc Settlement record sheet.\n\nIf a survivor gains a knowledge that has a higher level than the knowledge of the same name known in the settlement, the lower level is now obsolete. The higher level knowledge card replaces the obsolete knowledge in the knowledge deck, archive the obsolete knowledge. Update the Knowledge section to reflect this progress.\n\nIf the survivor gained knowledge that is a lower level than what is already known in the settlement, they benefit from others' experience. They gain the highest level of that knowledge known in the settlement. Do not add the lower level knowledge back into the knowledge deck.\n\nFor example, Lucy advances Tenacity I to Tenacity II. However, Tenacity III is already known in the settlement. Lucy gains Tenacity III instead.\n\nIf the survivor gained knowledge that is the same level as one they already know, nothing happens.\n\nRandom Knowledge.\nWhen survivors gain random knowledge, shuffle the knowledge deck, and draw from the top.\n\nFull Knowledge Slots.\nIf a survivor has 3 knowledges and gains a new one, they may choose to replace any but their tenet knowledge. If they gained the knowledge by advancing to the next level they must gain it. Erase the knowledge and record the new one.\n\nTenet Knowledge.\nWhile a survivor has their philosophy, the philosophy's tenet knowledge is permanent and cannot be lost or removed for any reason. For everyone else in the settlement, this survivor's tenet knowledge is the same as other knowledges. It is in the knowledge deck unless it is obsolete.\n\nIt is possible for a survivor to already have the knowledge that becomes their tenet knowledge. When this happens, simply move all of its information (including observations) into the tenet knowledge slot.\n\nGaining Fighting Arts.\nFighting arts are impulses that arc survivors do not have. Attempting to learn them puts their minds under immense stress. When fighting arts would be gained, arc survivors Vaultless instead. Through this story arc survivors may gain fighting arts.\n\nArc survivors can possess one fighting art and one secret fighting art.\n\nLosing Access to Knowledge.\nIf arc survivors cannot use their fighting arts they also cannot use their knowledge (e.g., when an arc survivor suffers the Ruptured Muscle permanent injury). If they cannot use knowledges they cannot accumulate observations. This includes tenet knowledges. However, arc survivors are always beholden to their neurosis.\n\nKnowledge Levels Up.\nCareful observation of experience accumulates until enough is gathered and knowledge evolves.\n\nPlayers should keep their knowledges' observation conditions in mind. When they occur, fill the corresponding observation box on the arc survivor record sheet. When the last box is filled, the knowledge levels up. You must level up a knowledge when its observations are full. Immediately gain the benefits of leveling up listed on the knowledge card.\n\nIn the chaos of existence, survivors may miss an opportunity for observation. Unless an observation is recorded at the moment it takes place, it is gone like so much ephemera. If a dangerous observation is missed, record it when you realize you missed it.\n\nKnowledge at the Forum.\nAfter unlocking the Forum collective cognition milestone, survivors gather there to share knowledge. In the excited bustle of conversation and demonstration, ideas can be shared!\n\nArc Survivors Share Knowledge.\nDuring the setup of the settlement phase, shuffle the knowledge deck and draw three cards, placing them next to the Forum settlement location. These are the knowledges shared by survivors this lantern year.\n\nDuring the Develop step, a survivor can select a knowledge card, pay its lumi cost, and gain it. Once gained, move the knowledge from the Forum back to the knowledge deck.\n\nSurvivors may spend lumi at the Forum to add more knowledge cards to the Forum.\n\nAs the collective cognition of the settlement improves, it unlocks other benefits of vigorous discourse.\n\nIn the spirit of collective cooperation, the lumi cost of some activities at the Forum can be paid by more than one survivor. Survivors may combine their lumi to jointly pay the cost of these activities.",

For years, the giant lay at the base of the mountain moaning as his wounds mended, cursing his folk, and vowing revenge.\n\nThe giant turned to the dark arts seeking power. His massive brain quickly absorbed what other scholars spent years mastering. Overtaking his teachers, he built the Black Citadel, charging students exorbitant fees to study by his side. With his massive wealth and army of the dead he finally laid waste to the giants of the Glittering Mountains.\n\nWary of a human apprentice, the Necromancer Boss cast a powerful love curse on him. Madly in love, the appetence's focus waned and his power too. When the apprentice's beloved perished, the apprentice gave his body to resurrect her. The Necromancer Boss knows that when his apprentice is returned, he will face retribution. \n\nContents.\n1 x Resin Necromancer Boss\nLarge matte print of the original concept artwork on heavy card stock\nCharacter art card\n\nNotes.\nUnlike most miniatures, the Necromancer Boss does not come with a base because the bottom of it is flat enough to stand upright. However, given its size, a 50mm base would be appropriate.\n\nDespite having lore associated with the Necromancer Generic Hero Class, the Necromancer Boss itself is not a Generic miniature, as indicated by the store page, art card, and box it is sold in.\n\nNecromancer-Boss-1_900x.jpg\nNecromancer-Boss-2_900x.jpg\nNecromancer-Boss-3_900x.jpg\nNecromancer-Boss-4_900x.jpg\nNecromancer-Boss-5_900x.jpg\nNecromancer-Boss-6_900x.jpg\nNecromancer-Boss-7_900x.jpg",

There, the initiates must join forces to rise to the challenge of returning home, or face a grisly demise in the unknown woods.

There are also minor versions of these, including only limbs being rebirthed.\n\nThe fact that much of this is uncontrollable does mean that there is a heavier amount of luck involved with a Phoenix hunt compared to other quarries.\n\nGood gear for Phoenix hunters.\nThe following items have additional value during a Phoenix hunt are listed below:",

      "term": "Scouts",
      "definition": "In past campaigns, the gruesome machinations of the world worked in the survivors' favor. Even if the hunting survivors were lost, their gear was inexorably returned to the settlement, carried by strange creatures that herald the survivors' demise.\n\nThe scout is an optional component that can be added to any campaign. Playing with scouts expands the simulation of survivors leaving the settlement without the security of their gear automatically returning.\n\nIf a scout is not present when the hunting survivors perish, all of the survivors' gear and resources are lost.\n\nIf a scout accompanied the hunting survivors when they perished, the scout must perform their grim duty and attempt to drag the settlement's valuables home.\n\nAdding Scouts.\nTo add scouts to a campaign, add Extinguished Guidepost to lantern year 1 of the timeline on your settlement record sheet. Replace the Pictograph innovation with Pictograph (Scout). Do not add Lamplighter to the settlement event deck until explicitly instructed.\n\nCurrent Campaign.\nThe scout introduces significant changes to your settlement and gameplay. It is not recommended as a mid-campaign addition.\n\nPeople of the Dream Keeper Uses Scouts.\nThe scout's introductory story event is already printed on the settlement record sheet timeline.\n\nScout Components.\nIn the somber wake of the prologue, the survivors know that monsters are relentless. Gathered at the extinguished guidepost, they make a promise. If they seek foes in the darkness, they must triumph or not return at all. Otherwise, monsters will follow the survivors back to decimate the settlement.\n\nDeath Pact.\nThe Death Pact innovation represents this promise. When the survivors are defeated or lost on the hunt, perform Logistics of Death, which describes what happens to the scout and the settlement's belongings.\n\nPictograph.\nThe settlement can special innovate Pictograph (Scout) after they gain the Death Pact innovation. Using a symbology of their own making, the scout deepens the settlement's understanding of their most powerful foes.\n\nScout Hunt Events.\nWhen the settlement gains their first scout, their hunts change. The scout hunt event card replaces a basic hunt event card. When the card is revealed during the hunt, the survivors confront new hunt events found in the Scout Hunt Event table.\n\nOutskirts.\nA darkened lantern halberd juts from the ground at the settlement's edge. In its gloomy shadow, the scout makes their preparations at the outskirts of the settlement. The Outskirts settlement location is gained during Extinguished Guidepost.\n\nAt the Outskirts, the settlement can craft scout gear that can be carried only in the scout's gear grid. The settlement can also endeavor to collect Hollow Stone strange resources.\n\nScout Gear Grid.\nThe scout carries a dread stinking roll so repulsive, the teeming darkness avoids it. When the scout finds themselves alone, they may use it to travel in questionable safety.\n\nThe scout uses a corresponding gear grid with only four free spaces; the remaining space is occupied by the burdensome Dreaded Pack.\n\nScout Keyword & Gear.\nThe scout's gear grid is the only gear grid that may hold gear with the scout keyword. The scout gear grid may include any gear that is not Cursed, because the Dreaded Pack cannot abide a Cursed presence. If the scout gains Cursed gear during the hunt or the showdown, they may never again depart as a scout.\n\nHunting with a Scout.\nWhen survivors depart, they may nominate a survivor to wear the Dreaded Pack. This survivor is the scout for that lantern year. The scout departs alongside up to four hunting survivors and gains all departing survivor bonuses.\n\nThis often means that five survivors depart, rather than four. If the scout survives to return to the settlement, they contribute endeavors as normal, even if they are the only one alive.\n\nHunt Phase.\nThe scout is part of the hunting party. They participate in and reveal hunt events just like other survivors. When an event affects all survivors, it affects the scout as well. The hunt event revealer takes charge of the scout.\n\nShowdowns with a Scout.\nThe scout is a survivor and participates in showdowns and encounters just like everyone else. They gain Arrival bonuses, gain Movement and Activation each act, and participate in the Aftermath.\n\nThe scout is placed last during Showdown/Encounter Setup. If there are no spaces remaining as indicated by Showdown Setup, place the scout in the closest unoccupied space to another survivor.\n\nEach round, the monster controller takes charge of the scout. The scout is not any player's survivor and does not gain insanity bonuses when targeted by the monster controller.\n\nHiding During the Showdown.\nThe Stone Face Cloak is scout gear that allows the scout to hide during the showdown. The scout's model is replaced by the Hidden Face terrain tile, which represents its camouflaged form. Its model waits on the corresponding terrain card.\n\nWhile off the showdown board, scouts cannot be targeted by the monster or suffer effects that the monster performs on all survivors. The terrain card shows how to return to the board.\n\nIf another game rule prevents the scout from placing the Hidden Face terrain tile, they cannot hide.\n\nThe Scout's Dreaded Choice.\nIf all other survivors perish, the scout has a choice: continue to fight, or end the showdown in Defeat and trigger Logistics of Death.\n\nLogistics of Death.\nIf the hunting survivors perish during the hunt or are defeated in the showdown, the settlement's death pact triggers Logistics of Death.\n\nBefore resolving Logistics of Death, resolve any hunt event outcomes and showdown defeat conditions.\n\nLogistics of Death describes the morbid procedure the scout endures to return the settlement's belongings. There are different procedures if the survivors perished chasing a quarry than if facing a nemesis.\n\nThe Recovery Team describes the outcomes of defeat after a nemesis showdown at the settlement's edge. By keenly observing the carnage, the scout may mitigate the devastation left by a rampaging nemesis.\n\nThe Long Journey Home describes what happens when the survivors perish on the hunt or in a showdown with a quarry monster, depending on whether the scout survives.\n\nIf the scout dies along with the hunting survivors, the settlement's prospects are dire. Everything is Lost to the Darkness.\n\nIf the scout dies during the hunt or showdown but the showdown ends in Victory, the Dreaded Pack and the scout's gear are carried home by the remaining victorious survivors.\n\nThe Dreaded Pack Is Lost.\nIf the scout and their gear are Lost to the Darkness during Logistics of Death, the settlement is in peril. Without the Dreaded Pack, the settlement cannot nominate a scout, recover the hunting party's belongings, or gain any other scouts benefits. A rare confluence of fortune may add another Dreaded Pack to the settlement, but it is unlikely.\n\nScout Discoveries.\nScouts bear witness to the hunting survivors' triumphs. In the wake of difficult victories, the scout explores the battlefield with fresh eyes.\n\nAfter the settlement innovates Pictograph, they may gain Scout Discoveries. The first time the survivors defeat a lvl 3+ quarry monster with a surviving scout, the scout gains that monster's Scout Discovery.\n\nResolve the victory conditions of the Aftermath, then the scout resolves the Scout Discovery.\n\nIf no Scout Discovery card exists for the defeated monster do not gain one.\n\nMonster Tablet.\nEach Scout Discovery enables the scout to create a corresponding monster tablet gear. Scouts commit their in-depth insights in scout shorthand onto wearisome slabs. Then, the scout uses them to coach the hunting survivors.\n\nEach tablet describes a useful maneuver that works only against that tablet's respective monster. The scout must be alive and carrying the tablet corresponding to the quarry at hand to use its effects.",

      "term": "Screaming Antelope/Strategy",
      "definition": "The Antelope is quite a skittish quarry, and begins to introduce a few dangerous mechanics, making it a more niche hunting target. It is a good source of Fresh Acanthus, as well as additional resources if critical hits can be utilized. \n\nHunt Events.\nThe hunt events for the Screaming Antelope for the most part are similar to the White Lion's in terms of danger level, but a few hunt events can ramp up the difficulty significantly, so can provide an additional level of risk to hunt.\n\nThings which you may experience on an antelope hunt:\nMinor brain damage\nMinor event damage\nMinor strength loss\nMinor additional resources\nMinor skipping forward hunt spaces\nMajor Healing\nMinor chance of Fresh Acanthus\nMajor quarry moving away hunt spaces\n\nMigration and friends.\nMigration and a few other hunt events form a family of events which can make a hunt much more difficult than expected. Migration moves the quarry 3 squares further away from the survivors, but there are other events which cause 1 square movements. This can be beneficial for some groups as they can explore more hunt events, but for newer hunts it can be lethal. Forcing Overwhelming Darkness on survivors when not expected is an easy way to stop a hunt,\n\nDead Antelope.\nSometimes you are not the only thing hunting the Screaming Antelope. If a White Lion kills the antelope before you do, then you will be forced into a powered up Lion fight which nets you antelope resources from the carrion in addition to the lion. It's a situation which can be accounted for and even be used as a strategy, but can ruin some hunting groups.\n\nThe Showdown.\nThe Antelope has a similar macro strategy than the Lion, but some different specifics. The Antelope is a very mobile target, often making attacks and then making a second move away from survivors, which makes it quite difficult to lay in a good round of four hunters outputting heavy damage.\n\nThe fight starts in a patch of Acanthus plants, which are relevant for both foraging, as well as being a significant source of healing for the Antelope. The Antelope can heal 1d5 wounds from eating a single plant, which is quite a large setback if a 4 or 5 is rolled.\n\nThe antelope also has a number of ways to mess with survivors' weapons. It has a number of Super-Dense locations, breaking bone gear. In addition, the beast has some situations which can have weapons knocked out of hand, or even grabbed by the large undermouth. Extra weapons are recommended to compensate.\n\nIt does have a weakness though. A large number of hit locations have -2 toughness on locations wounded with a Shield or Club type weapon. This is quite a consistent experience, so packing weapons of this type can help punch through damage\n\nIn summary, some good things to remember during the showdown are:\nThe blind spot can get targeted by powerful kicks\nHarvesting Acanthus to prevent healing can be utilized\nUse Shields or Clubs for +2 to wound\nCardinal Directions can be a deathtrap as the antelope gets bonus damage when trampling\nBe aware of weapons being knocked away or eaten\nBone weapons can break with some regularity\nDash will allow you to keep up with the very mobile quarry\n\nGood gear for Screaming Antelope hunters.\nThe following items have additional value during a Screaming Antelope hunt are listed below:",

      "definition": "Tasting Notes are a community-driven endeavor where rules questions are submitted to Tastemaker and Team Death through the Lantern's Reign discord. These questions are answered by the team on their free time, and on occasion are added to the official FAQ.\n\nTasting Notes should be considered semi-official rulings to rules questions and always have the following caveat: \"Please note that these answers apply to the current live version of Kingdom Death: Monster. Subsequent releases may introduce new rules or change existing products in a way that affects the following clarifications or renders them irrelevant.\"\n\nNOTE: These questions and answers include responses for content from the Gambler's Chest Expansion, so may include information that could be considered a spoiler.\n\nQuestions and Answers.\n\nQ: What node is the White Gigalion? Do you gain CC from fighting it separately from a White Lion?.\nA: The White Gigalion is a node 1 monster. It is not treated as a separate entity from the White Lion for purposes of CC.\n\nQ: One of the roll results upon choosing \"Collective Toil\" during \"Principle: Society\" states that survivors should gain 2 random White Lion resources. Should this be treated as 2 random Node 1 resources in campaigns that do not include the White Lion?.\nA: Gain 2 random White Lion resources as instructed. These are Node 1 monster resources. However, do note that you will likely not have access to the Catarium or other settlement locations/gear recipe sources that require specific White Lion resources if your campaign does not include the White Lion.\n\nQ: Does the clause \"before you make a wound attempt/before making a wound attempt...\" (Blood Compass Lantern, Rawhide Bandana, etc.) mean \"before making any wound attempts in an attack\" or \"before making a wound attempt (on a chosen hit location)\"?.\nA: The latter. This means that an effect that occurs \"before making a wound attempt\" in an attack with multiple hit locations can occur before making a wound attempt against any of these hit locations.\n\nQ: The 1-3 roll result of Gorm Climate instructs players to dismantle an innovation, returning it to the innovation deck. What types of innovations can be chosen to be returned to the innovation deck? Does dismantling an innovation count as archiving it?.\nA: All innovations that the settlement has access to are applicable to be dismantled. When an innovation is returned to the innovation deck, the settlement loses access to the effects associated with that innovation until it is gained again from the innovation deck. Dismantling an innovation is not archiving it.\n\nQ: If a weapon mastery is dismantled by Gorm Climate while there is no associated master in the settlement, is it placed in the innovation deck, or returned to the weapon proficiency deck?.\nA: It is returned to the weapon proficiency deck.\n\nQ: Can a gear with arrows in the Second Stomach survivor status card point to another piece of gear in your gear grid? Can a piece of gear in the Second Stomach survivor status card be pointed to by a piece of gear with arrows in your gear grid? Can a gear in the Second Stomach survivor status card with affinity halves connect with another piece of gear in your gear grid with affinity halves?.\nA: No, no, and no. However, gear in the Second Stomach survivor status card are still treated as being in your gear grid for the purposes of affinity bonuses, so a gear with an affinity bonus in the Second Stomach survivor status card can still gain its affinity bonus effect if you have the prerequisite affinities completed in the rest of your gear grid.\n\nQ: The Dark Impulse 3 knowledge allows a survivor to gain all of the positive attributes of another survivor they kill. What exactly does this entail?.\nA: Dark Impulse 3 allows a survivor to gain the permanent positive attributes (from baseline) of another survivor they kill. For example, a survivor with Dark Impulse 3 kills another survivor with 6 movement, 1 strength, and -1 accuracy. The first survivor gains +1 movement (as the killed survivor had +1 movement from their baseline of 5), +1 strength, and no accuracy (as Dark Impulse only grants positive attributes). Unless otherwise qualified with a timing (e.g.- \"until end of the attack\"), attributes described in philosophies and their corresponding knowledge cards refer to \"permanent attributes\" (Gambler's Chest Rulebook pg. 69). This means that Dark Impulse 3 does account for Attribute Modifier Token attribute tokens or other temporary attribute bonuses. Systemic Pressure and Torment are survivor attributes and can be granted by Dark Impulse 3. Lumi, while a survivor trait like survival or insanity, is not a survivor attribute. (Gambler's Chest Rulebook pg. 67).\n\nQ: Placing 3 knowledge cards face up next to the Forum (Share) normally occurs during the settlement phase setup once the settlement gains access to the Forum settlement location. Do you place these 3 knowledge cards the first time the Forum settlement location is gained, considering it is gained after settlement phase setup?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: (Arc) Intimacy grants bonuses if you \"earned [at least X] CC this year\". However, CC is recorded during the Aftermath. Does this mean that you only gain the bonuses for (Arc) Intimacy if you gained the requisite amount of CC during the current lantern year?.\nA: Collective Cognition is recorded during the Aftermath (specifically, after the Aftermath has been resolved) in order to minimize the chances of players forgetting to update their Collective Cognition. The intent behind the (Arc) Intimacy bonuses is to check if your Collective Cognition has increased in the current lantern year's settlement phase in comparison to the last lantern year's settlement phase (the full phrase of which could not fully fit within the confines of the story event).\n\nQ: Should Skull and Handed Skull have the skull keyword?.\nA: Skull should have the skull keyword. Handed Skull is too large to be used as an analogous material in crafting recipes that require skull resources to have the skull keyword.\n\nQ: When a survivor gains a nickname, would this qualify as \"being named\"? Can a survivor have a nickname and no name?.\nA: No. Yes.\n\nQ: How does the Dung Beetle Knight's Trap, Slam Dunk, work if the monster is not adjacent to the attacker after it full moves directly towards the attacker?.\nA: If the monster is not adjacent to the attacker after it full moves directly towards the attacker, it with neither place the monster in any space adjacent to the Resin Dung Ball nor have the attacker suffer damage and gain the Smell World survivor status card.\n\nQ: Are milestones considered events? Are they once per lifetime? The Milestone section in the rulebook never mentions milestones are once per lifetime. Some events that are triggered upon reaching a Milestone clarify that the specific event itself is once per lifetime..\nA: A milestone is a set of circumstances that can be fulfilled (e.g.- having 16 Hunt XP, having 8 weapon proficiency levels, having 10 Death Count, etc.). Milestones are not events.\n\nAt baseline, milestones do not have rules associated with them. However, events may occur when specific milestones are reached. These events occur at the moment the specific milestone is reached. These events are generally known as Milestone Events (e.g.- Hooded Knight is a Milestone Story Event that occurs when a settlement has 5 innovations. If Hooded Knight is not an available Story Event within your campaign, nothing happens when your settlement reaches 5 innovations).\n\nQ: Curse Conductor allows a survivor to gain the monster controller tile when they wound the monster with an arrow. Does this extend to the Death Die?.\nA: No. Curse Conductor (and analogous effects such as Gloom Hammer) only allow survivors to gain the monster controller tile, and do not extend to effects that replace the monster controller tile, like the Death Die. If a survivor is instructed to gain the monster controller tile while it is not in play, nothing happens.\n\nQ: Can the 1-2 and 7+ roll results of Baby and the Sword Hunt Event be rerolled?.\nA: Yes. However, once players begin resolving the Harvester hunt event (Hunt Event 10), that particular event cannot be rerolled or avoided.\n\nQ: Is it intended for the Baby and the Sword hunt event to only remove itself from the Hunt Event Deck on a roll result of 7+?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: When a survivor is suffering from an effect that lowers their total affinities of a color, how does this interact with an affinity bonus that requires puzzle affinities of that color? How does this interact with Prismatic?.\nA: When a survivor is suffering from an effect that lowers their total affinities of a color, an affinity bonus that requires puzzle affinities of that color is only active if the requisite puzzle affinities are connected and the survivor has enough affinities of that color such that the survivor is able to activate the affinity bonus even after adjusting their total number of affinities. A survivor with an effect that lowers their total affinities of a color and Prismatic will decrease their total number of affinities by the appropriate amount, as complete affinities of Prismatic survivors count as all colors.\n\nQ: How does Weapon Mastery innovation creation work? Innovations can be lost. Does this mean that, because this is not a triggered event, nor once per lifetime, that a Master will instantly recreate a lost Mastery Innovation? Is this the same for a survivor with 8 proficiency levels starting a new settlement in a new game+? They show up and instantly create the innovation in the new settlement? Do they need the ranks still filled in on the their survivor sheet? When a Master switches weapon proficiency types they still remain a master of that weapon type. Is this enough to recreate an innovation?.\nA: A Weapon Mastery innovation is created when a survivor has the max amount of weapon proficiency levels on the corresponding weapon type. If a Weapon Mastery innovation is lost while a survivor still has the max amount of weapon proficiency levels, the Weapon Mastery innovation will be recreated. If a Weapon Mastery innovation is lost after the survivor that reached the max amount of weapon proficiency levels has changed their proficiency, the innovation will not be recreated.\n\nQ: When a survivor reaches Mastery, they also become a “Master” of whatever weapon type they had selected at the time. Where on the survivor record sheet should this be written? Is this meant to be tracked? Is this considered an ability or something else?.\nA: The survivor who achieved Mastery should be tracked, Players may record this information in that survivor's record sheet or the settlement's record sheet. This is not considered a survivor ability.\n\nQ: If a Shield Master has the Shielderang fighting art and decides to switch weapon proficiencies, will they still be considered to have 8 levels of Shield weapon proficiency?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: What happens when an insane survivor is adjacent to two other survivors with Boss Mehndi in their gear grids?.\nA: The insane survivor would gain +2 speed while adjacent to the two other survivors.\n\nQ: Can survivors that become the starting survivors for a new settlement via Clinging Mists start a settlement that belongs to a different campaign from the settlement they were originally from?.\nA: Yes. Note that this may cause slight discrepancies or issues in regards to game rules. Where issues arise, players should determine as a group how they would like to resolve the issue, ruling against the survivors' favor when possible.\n\nQ: Can a survivor originally from a People of the Sun settlement with access to the Embolden and Overcharge survival actions utilize these survival actions after becoming a starting survivor for a different settlement?.\nA: No. In this instance, the survivor's ability to utilize the Embolden and Overcharge survival actions arose from settlement-specific innovations that do not exist within their new settlement. Similarly, the survivor's survival limit is determined by the survival limit of their new settlement and not the last known survival limit of their previous settlement.\n\nQ: Do damage modifiers (e.g.- +1 damage tokens, +1 damage due the monster level) increase the damage of attack profiles that have \"-\" listed as their damage?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: Extreme Heat says survivors may not wear heavy gear. When a survivor is prevented from wearing a gear type, they are unable to place that type of gear in their gear grid. How would you gain the White Sunlion Hybrid Armor set bonus to ignore this if you cannot wear it to begin with?.\nA: A survivor may elect to claim the White Sunlion Hybrid Armor set bonus by placing all of the appropriate gear pieces in their gear grid. If all the pieces of gear associated with the White Sunlion Hybrid Armor Set have been placed on the gear grid and the Sunlion Hybrid Armor set bonus is active for the survivor, the effect of the set bonus to ignore Extreme Heat is applicable, allowing the survivor to wear the appropriate gear pieces. If this is not the case, the survivor must immediately remove any worn heavy gear within their gear grid.\n\nQ: Can a survivor with Sweet Battle without access to the Surge survival action perform Surge?.\nA: Yes. Sweet Battle states \"you may use Sweet Battle even if your settlement cannot normally surge. You may also use Sweet Battle when you have no survival and/or cannot spend survival. This does not let you surge more than once per round.\"\n\nQ: The rulebook states that survivors are always in the monster's field of view unless they are in the monster's blind spot or the monster's line of sight is blocked. The FAQ suggests that a survivor on a Giant Stone Face can be both in the monster's field of view and blind spot at the same time. How can this be?.\nA: The FAQ entry is an obsolete one from an earlier version of the game. The Giant Stone Face terrain has an explicit rule that \"monsters may always draw a line of sight to [survivors atop the Giant Stone Face]\". Thus, a survivor atop a Giant Stone Face is always in the monster's field of view, unless they are standing in the monster's blind spot.\n\nQ: When performing a Forest Run during a Bloom People campaign, can players include the Bleeding Corpse Lily strange resource when drawing random Flower Resources?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Heart Flute states “You play a trill note. Select any Nemesis” to trigger a special showdown with. Does this include Core and Finale monsters? Does this include Nemeses not found in your campaign?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: The 6+ result of the Heart Flute innovation instructs you to add a special showdown with the selected nemesis at the highest level you have not yet faced to the timeline this year. Is this correct?.\nA: This is a typographical error. The 6+ result of Heart Flute should read: \"You play a trill note. Select any Nemesis monster. Add a Special Showdown with them (at the next highest level you have not yet faced) to the timeline this year. You cannot endeavor here again this phase.\n\nQ: How often does Bloodthirsty gain a token?.\nA: Any time a survivor suffers damage for any reason. For example, a survivor who suffers 2 hits of 1 damage from the White Lion’s Basic Action would put 2 tokens on Bloodthirsty. A survivor and their two adjacent survivors suffering damage from the danger seizure brain trauma would put 3 tokens on Bloodthirsty.\n\nQ: How does Invincible interact with Devastating? How does it interact with automatic wounds?.\nA: When the Butcher is wounded, roll 1d10. On a result of 8+, the wound attempt fails instead. Do not move any AI cards to the monster’s wound stack and perform any applicable monster reactions due to the failed wound attempt.\n\nQ: Gloom Man states ”when you move, place yourself anywhere on the showdown board\". Does this include all movement (e.g.- spending movement, knockback, etc.)?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: None of the individual pieces that grant the Rolling Armor Set Bonus have the armor keyword. Does that mean survivors can have the pieces of gear in their gear grid even when effects such as Extreme Heat prevent survivors from wearing armor with specific keywords?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: The Outfit special rule states \"This completes an armor set if you're wearing the rest of the set and it shares a material keyword with the missing armor gear.\" Can this be used with the Rolling Armor Set Bonus?.\nA: Outfit serves as a replacement for another piece of armor gear. As none of the individual pieces that grant the Rolling Armor Set Bonus are armor gear, none of them can be replaced using Outfit.\n\nQ: How do hits occurring outside of attack profiles work?.\nA: Rules for how hits outside of attack profiles work can be found on pg. 193 of the Core Rulebook.\n\nQ: Does Spinning Halberd affect ammo? Does it affect wounds that occur from non-ranged sources that narratively occur from a distance (e.g.- thrown Founding Stone, Deathpact)?.\nA: Ammo inherits the range of the weapon they are ammo for. For example, a Claw Head Arrow inheriting the range of an Arc Bow in the survivor's gear grid has Range 6. Attacks made with the \"Range: X\" special rule are ranged attacks. Spinning Halberd does not affect wounds that occur from non-ranged sources. However, players may come to a narrative consensus that an effect will not affect the monster while Spinning Halberd is in play due to its \"ranged\" nature.\n\nQ: Is there timing restrictions for naming an unnamed survivor?.\nA: No, unless an effect explicitly states otherwise\n\nQ: Can survivors use Secret Fighting Arts when frenzied?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: The flee brain trauma directs players to suffer knockback equal to their movement towards the closest board edge. If the survivor is already adjacent to the board edge, how do you resolve the knockback?.\nA: If knockback or monster movement starts at a showdown board edge and would go off it, instead move along the board edge (see Core Game Rulebook pg. 72 for a further clarifying diagram).\n\nQ: If a monster is standing in between a survivor and the board edge nearest to the survivor for the purposes of the flee brain trauma, what happens when that survivor suffers flee?.\nA: The survivor suffers knockback equal to their movement towards the nearest board edge, into the monster. If a survivor would suffer knockback into a monster, treat the tiles the monster occupies as impassable terrain. The survivor suffers collision and stops their movement in the last space before the monster.\n\nQ: Can you obtain multiple copies of gear like Scoopy Club and Ancient Root if you fulfill the conditions to gain the gear multiple times?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Are pieces of gear with attack profiles that do not have the weapon keyword (e.g.- Bone Sickle, Corsair Coat) considered weapons?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: Does the Corsair Coat attack if the survivor wearing it dashes into a space out of range of the Corsair Coat?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: What facets of the survivor are considered permanent attributes?.\nA: A survivor's permanent attributes are their: movement, accuracy, strength, evasion, speed, and luck.\n\nQ: Do armor points accrued from effects (e.g.- Shrine, Crystal Skin) count as \"wearing\" armor for the purposes of effects that account for wearing armor gear?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: Can the Silk Nest terrain tile be archived during a showdown with Spidicules?.\nA: The Silk Nest terrain tile has a typographical error. It should have the Indestructible special rule.\n\nQ: If a monster is instructed to move or full move to/towards something (e.g.- Move & Attack Target, Screaming Antelope’s Graze) does the monster end its movement adjacent to or on top of the target?.\nA: The monster ends its move adjacent to the target, facing the target.\n\nQ: If there are multiple copies of the same weapon in your gear grid, and the copy you have designated to provide benefits is archived, can you designate another copy?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Can the Manhunter AI Piercing Blow archive indestructible terrain?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: Is rolling on the Basic Hunt Event Table considered rolling on a table?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Can Otherworldly Luck be used to avoid the Harvester Hunt Event by changing a Hunt Event Table roll result of 10 to 11?.\nA: Harvester cannot be avoided in any way. \n\nQ: Does healing a permanent injury also remove the penalties incurred from having that permanent injury?.\nA: Yes. (e.g.- A survivor that has -4 permanent accuracy and is retired solely due to having two blind permanent injuries would only have -1 permanent accuracy and no longer be retired if one of their blind permanent injuries is cured, a survivor that cannot use fighting arts due to a hamstrung permanent injury would be able to use fighting arts again if their hamstrung permanent injury is cured, etc.)\n\nQ: What are “indirect activations”?.\nA: Indirect activations refer to any effect that causes a piece of gear to activate that is not present on the gear itself. This includes effects such as Charge, Pounce, Skewer, Blood Paint, etc. Cumbersome is a gear special rule that places an additional activation restriction (survivors must spend movement and activation to activate Cumbersome gear) on the gear unless it is activated through an indirect activation. Indirect activations do not bypass other additional activation restrictions (e.g.- Sentient) unless they are explicitly stated to be able to do so.\n\nQ: Charge does not mention attacking with a weapon, but does not mention you must activate the weapon first. Does that mean that you do not activate a weapon when you attack with it using Charge?.\nA: No. Attacking with a weapon is activating the weapon for the purposes of attacking. If a survivor is unable to activate a weapon due to an activation restriction (e.g.- Sentient), the are unable to attack with it. \n\nQ: Are Saviors immune to King’s Curse?.\nA: No. (The FAQ suggesting otherwise is an obsolete entry from a previous version of the game.)\n\nQ: Is the Virulent Incantation card correct?.\nA: There are two typographical errors On Virulent Incantation. The statement “Target a random survivor. Attack target, then discard this card.” should read as “Target a random survivor. Attack target.” In addition, the attack profile should not have an After Damage trigger.\n\nQ: How does the Immovable Object secret fighting art work?.\nA: There is a typographical error on Immovable Object. It should read as: “If you are in an otherwise unoccupied space, you stand firm in the face of any force. You cannot be knocked down and may ignore knockback.” An otherwise unoccupied space is determined by whether or not the space is empty of any other models, tiles, tokens, and terrain if the survivor is not occupying the space. This means that Immovable Object is not applicable when a survivor is occupying a space that is occupied by another survivor, a space with terrain (whether it is impassable like Stone Columns or terrain that survivors are able to occupy the same space with like Tall Grass), a space with a token on it, a space that is occupied by the monster, etc. \n\nQ: A survivor with Immovable Object suffers bash and knockback 10 while standing on terrain. In the midst of their knockback, they move onto an otherwise unoccupied space. What happens?.\nA: Immovable Object does not retroactively prevent effects that occurred while it was not applicable. Even though the survivor is now in a position where they cannot be knocked down and may ignore knockback due to the effects of Immovable Object, they are in the midst of resolving an effect that occurred when they were not immune to being knocked down or knocked back and must finish resolving the effect. The survivor finishes the knockback effect and remains knocked down.\n\nQ: Is a survivor affected by Whiplash if they are in the monster’s blind spot?.\nA: No. If a survivor is considered to be in the monster’s blind spot (e.g.- standing in the appropriate positioning, Zero Presence, etc.), they will not receive bleeding tokens due to Whiplash.\n\nQ: Sometimes there are scenarios where direct contradictions arise within the rules (e.g.- Doomed prevents all actions while Warriors of the Sun- Reflection allows a survivor to dodge at any time, even while doomed). What should be done when such a scenario occurs?.\nA: When conflict arises over direct contradictions in rules, apply specific rules found on cards and story events (e.g.- Warriors of the Sun- Reflection) before any rules found in the rulebook core rules sections (e.g.- Core Rules pg 75- Doomed). When contradictions arise between specific rules (e.g.- Path of Gloom and Stark Raving), rule against the survivors' favor.\n\nQ: Does being able to dodge at any time mean that dodge can be performed without spending survival?.\nA: No. Being able to dodge at any time is a modifying effect placed upon the dodge survival action that allows you to perform dodge on occasions when dodge would normally be prohibited (e.g.- while you are attacking, doomed, or otherwise unable to perform survival actions). It does not modify the definition of dodge beyond this, which consists of “when a survivor is hit, they may spend 1 survival to dodge, canceling a monster hit. After hit locations are rolled, but before any severe injury rolls, the survivor can dodge a hit of their choice.”\n\nQ: Should survivors continue to track leftover armor points during the settlement phase? Can armor points from a previous lantern year stack with armor points generated for departing survivors?.\nA: No. Armor points are not maintained during the settlement phase, and cannot be “carried over”.\n\nQ: Does the 1-5 roll result on the Black Mask Innovation kill the endeavoring survivor?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: The Balcony and Throne terrain cards refer to the survivors standing. Does this refer to the gameplay sense of standing?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: When the Lion Knight performs Encore and is placed in the center of the showdown board, do the survivors that occupy those spaces suffer collision before being placed in the survivor starting spaces?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: The Brawler Armor set bonus states that the Skull Helm cannot be destroyed. Does this protection include effects other than its own effect?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Certain Story Events have colored boxes that modify roll results if specific requirements are met. Are these effects additive, replacement effects, or context dependent?.\nA: Roll result modifiers are context dependent. Steps are being taken in future products to be clear when a specific roll modifier is additive or a replacement effect.\n\nQ: Does Screaming Oni Armor Flay turn 1s into Perfect hits if they are the highest roll, or are they still automatic failures?.\nA: Flay treats the two highest attack rolls of an attack with a dagger as Perfect hits, regardless of numerical value. If the two highest attack rolls of the attack are 1s, they will still hit and count as Perfect hits for the purposes of any effects that trigger on Perfect hits.\n\nQ: Does a survivor returned to the settlement prematurely via a stated effect during the Hunt or Showdown (e.g.- Run Away, Phoenix's Analtorium) count as a returning survivor?.\nA: No. Survivors prematurely returned to the settlement are not treated as returning survivors unless explicitly stated.\n\nQ: How does doomed work?.\nA: Doomed prevents a survivor from performing any actions until they are no longer doomed. This includes using fighting arts, knowledges, abilities, weapon proficiency, armor set bonuses, survival actions, spending movement or activation, gear special rules, resource effects, etc.\n\nQ: One of the ingredients to craft Fetorsaurus, the Sleeping Virus Flower, is Cursed. How does this work?.\nA: Players may spend the Sleeping Virus Flower to craft Fetorsaurus as if it were not Cursed. A future product will update how crafting with the Sleeping Virus Flower occurs.\n\nQ: When a disemboweled survivor dies at the end of the Showdown after defeating a monster, does the Showdown end in Victory or Defeat? What happens when a Victory occurs with no living survivors?.\nA: A disemboweled survivor dying during the Aftermath after defeating a monster causes the Showdown to end in Victory with no living survivors. During such an occurrence, resolve all applicable effects (e.g.- adding the monster to the Defeated Monsters section of the settlement record sheet) while disregarding any that cannot occur (e.g.- survivors gaining Hunt XP, as there are no survivors alive to do so). As all survivors have perished during the Showdown Phase, any resources they were carrying or would gain from Rewards are lost.\n\nQ: Should expansions use the Rules Update for Special Showdowns found in the core game rulebook?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Is the Beast Kunai a weapon? It does not have the weapon keyword, but has the dagger keyword..\nA: The Beast Kunai is not a weapon for keyword purposes (e.g.- Giant Mouth Reflex Reaction). It is a dagger for keyword purposes (e.g.- Aichmophobia, Weapon Proficiency).\n\nQ: How does the armor keyword interact with Accessory on the same item?.\nA: Survivors can only wear one piece of armor at each location, even if the gear has the Accessory special rule. A piece of gear with the armor keyword and the Accessory special rule will be affected by both effects that pertain to Accessories and effects that pertain to armor.\n\nQ: If a survivor is eligible for multiple Armor Set Bonuses, are they able to claim all of them together?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Under what circumstances can a survivor use lifetime rerolls/reroll tokens? Can a roll result that has already been rerolled be rerolled again?.\nA: Survivors with a lifetime reroll/reroll token can spend it to reroll any single roll result that they are present for. This includes any dice that survivor rolls (e.g.- a d10 roll for the survivor, a d10 roll for the monster while the survivor has the monster controller tile, a hit location roll, etc.), and any dice that survivor is deemed \"present\" for according to narrative consensus. Players are recommended to suggest that a survivor is \"present\" only when they have sufficient narrative cause to do so. After a roll result has been rerolled, the new result must be kept and cannot be rerolled again.\n\nQ: White Lion hit locations use the phrasing \"any survivors passed over suffer \"Grab\". Is there any mechanical difference between being passed over and colliding? Does the White Lion Grabbing survivors circumvent/prevent other effects that occur during collision from happening (e.g.- knocked down from collision, knockback 5 from the monster ending its movement on the survivor, Amber Poleaxe's special rule, Tumble, etc.)?.\nA: No. No.\n\nQ: When a survivor has the ability to gain monster level weapon experience after a nemesis fight (such as axe proficiency for the Butcher), do they need to be eligible (have wounded a monster at least once with the weapon type), to gain the proficiency?.\nA: Yes. A survivor must still be eligible to gain weapon-specific weapon proficiency from the Aftermath of a nemesis fight.\n\nQ: When do you choose a quarry to hunt? How do limitations like Flower Addiction, Megalophobia, and Dead Guardian affect your quarry choice?.\nA: Players choose a quarry to hunt at the beginning of the Hunt Phase, immediately after Table Setup, before departing on the hunt. Survivors may choose a quarry from the list of available monsters on the Quarry List of their settlement, and choose a monster level based on the levels available to their settlement. Effects like Flower Addiction, Megalophobia, and Dead Guardian restrict the quarry you are able to choose during this step. If these restrictions prevent the survivors from choosing all options that are available to them, the hunt ends in failure.\n\nQ: Do resource effects that occur within settlement storage (e.g.- Gibbering Haremite, Lump of Atnas) trigger multiple times if there are multiple of those resources within the settlement storage?.\nA: Yes. Lump of Atnas has a typographical error. The text on Lump of Atnas should read as: \"At the start of the settlement phase, if there are 5+ Lumps of Atnas in settlement storage, their scent draws a survivor, sniffing through the darkness. Gain +1 population with a random disorder. Gain this benefit once per settlement phase, regardless of how many Lumps are in storage.\"\n\nQ: What happens when a settlement consists of only 4 departing survivors and the Gibbering Haremite causes the settlement to suffer -1 population?.\nA: The settlement suffers -1 population, causing the settlement to consist of only 3 departing survivors.\n\nQ: Can survivors archive Vital gear as normal?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Final Lantern has the \"other\" keyword. What happens when a Savior or survivor with the Superstitious disorder acquires it outside of the Settlement Phase?.\nA: Saviors may not wear any gear with the \"other\" keyword due to Life Exchange. The Final Lantern is not a piece of armor or an accessory and is therefore not worn. Superstitious survivors cannot depart or activate \"other\" gear in their gear grid. This does not preclude them from acquiring the Final Lantern after departure, and the rules associated with the Final Lantern do not involve activation. Both Superstitious survivors and Saviors can acquire the Final Lantern as normal outside of the Settlement Phase.\n\nQ: What specific resource do you gain from the 2+ roll result of the Dead Warrior Hunt Event?.\nA: You gain a Monster Bone basic resource.\n\nQ: Should Aichmophobia be extended to other weapon types aside from the currently listed ones?.\nA: No.\n\nQ: How do the timings of \"After Hit\" and \"dodge\" interact?.\nA: After Hits effects occur after determining hits from a monster's attack roll, before rolling hit location dice. Dodging occurs after rolling hit location dice, before damage. As After Hit effects trigger before survivors have the opportunity to dodge, survivors cannot use dodge to circumvent After Hit effects.\n\nQ: How does Graze function if there are no Acanthus Plants on the showdown board?.\nA: The Screaming Antelope will full move forward in a straight line.\n\nQ: What does Sideswipe do?.\nA: What does it do indeed.\n\nQ: Are the Vault Key Earrings intended to work with a survivor with the Fear of the Dark disorder?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: The fighting art Blotted Out states \"When you suffer a brain trauma, gain a bleeding token,\" What does this mean?.\nA: Whenever a survivor with Blotted Out suffers a brain trauma, they gain a bleeding token as well.\n\nQ: Can a survivor Tumble while knocked down?.\nA: Yes. If a survivor successfully tumbles out of harms way while knocked down, they are placed standing on the closest free space outside of the collision path.\n\nQ: Does Frenzy prevent all fighting arts from working?.\nA: Yes. For example, a frenzied survivor with Tough would not add +1 to their result when rolling on a severe injury table, nor would a frenzied survivor with Rhythm Chaser remove all of their +1 evasion tokens when knocked down if they do not have an instrument in their gear grid.\n\nQ: When a science endeavor is prevented, does that only prevent endeavoring from those specific cards (e.g.- Albedo), or does it prevent endeavoring of any kind that requires a science innovation (e.g.- Leathermaking at the Leather Worker)?.\nA: When a specific type of endeavor is prevented, survivors may not perform any kind of endeavor that requires an innovation of that specific type.\n\nQ: The Armored Fist fighting art requires fist & tooth proficiency to work. If a fist & tooth master has this fighting art and decides to switch to another weapon proficiency, will Armored Fist continue to work?.\nA: Yes. Weapon masters and specialists are proficient at the weapons they master/specialize in.\n\nQ: The Ambidextrous fighting art cannot be used if there are shields, two-handed, or heavy gear in your gear grid. Is this a rule of Ambidextrous, or are these restrictions an inherent aspect of the Paired keyword?.\nA: The restrictions on Ambidextrous pertain only to the fighting art.\n\nQ: How does Clarity of Darkness/Path of Gloom interact with effects like Husk of Destiny or Stark Raving that make you \"always insane\"?.\nA: When direct contradictions arise between specific rules, as is with the case of Path of Gloom and Stark Raving/Husk of Destiny, rule against the survivors' favor. A survivor who is \"always insane\" and \"not insane unless they have 5+ insanity\" is not insane unless they have 5+ insanity.\n\nQ: Under what circumstances do you gain the benefits of your settlement's Death Principle]?.\nA: Do not gain the benefits of your settlement's Death Principle from survivors that are exiled, leave the settlement, or cease to exist. In cases where a survivor is stated to have both \"died\" and \"been exiled/left the settlement/ceased to exist\" (e.g.- King's Curse), do not gain the benefits of your settlement's Death Principle. Gain the benefits of your settlement's Death Principle from all other survivors that die, including from population loss, unless explicitly stated otherwise.\n\nQ: What constitutes a \"cold\" hunt event as per Grim Muffler?.\nA: Whether a Hunt Event can be designated as \"cold\" should be determined by narrative consensus within your play group, similarly to determining a group's \"favorite survivor\" for Hunt Reenactment, or whether or not the story of a Weird Dream is \"well told\". Players are recommended to suggest that a hunt event is \"cold\" only when they have sufficient narrative cause to do so, and should refrain from suggesting any hunt event that causes survival loss (e.g.- Basic Hunt Event 20: Dry Lands) is a \"cold\" hunt event.\n\nQ: Under what circumstances do the special rules of a weapon apply outside of when it is activated?.\nA: The special rules of a weapon are always only applicable when the weapon is activated unless 1) the rule specifies an effect that can only occur within a timing outside of the showdown, or 2) the rule is explicitly stated to be applicable during a timing outside of activations. Examples of the following are:\n1) Round Leather Shield (Adding armor points to hit locations occurs during Prepare Departing Survivors in the Settlement Phase), Vespertine Foil (Spending a resource or archiving the weapon occurs during the beginning of the Settlement Phase), Digging Claw (Rerolling on the Mineral Gathering Story Event occurs during the Hunt Phase).\n2) Amber Poleaxe (the effect of the monster suffering a wound is tied to the timing of \"the monster colliding with you\"), Fetorsaurus (the effect of reducing is tied to the timing of \"while you are carrying Fetorsaurus\"), Scoopy Club (the effect of filling the club and gaining the ability to Daze monsters when wounding with Scoopy Club is tied to the timing of \"when you vomit, are vomited on, or are adjacent to vomit.\").\n\nQ: Does using the Legs Locked Pulse discovery count as your once per round usage of the Death Die?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Can you use Metabolic Surrender when you do not have the Death Die?.\nA: No. You can use Metabolic Surrender at any time during the showdown while you are in possession of the Death Die.\n\nQ: The Ashen Claw Strain adds both the Armored Fist fighting art and the Fiddler Crab Spider vermin to your game. When starting a new campaign, is the Fiddler Crab Spider permanently included as a vermin resource, or is it only added if Armored Fist is also present in that campaign?.\nA: Fiddler Crab Spider should only be added to your campaign if Armored Fist is also present.\n\nQ: The ability \"Reflection\" states that you may \"dodge at any time, and as many times as you like each round\". Does this allow you to dodge while you are attacking or doomed?.\nA: Yes. Reflective allows you to perform dodge during timings when you are normally prohibited. Note that Reflective does not allow you to avoid damage that dodge does not normally prevent, such as damage outside of attack actions. In addition, being able to dodge while doomed does not allow you to perform any other action aside from dodging while you are doomed (e.g.- you cannot activate the Rawhide Armor Set Bonus effect while dodging when you are doomed).\n\nQ===. How do you perform a Spiral Formation Attack? Can you perform a Spiral Formation Attack and a Combined Attack (Principle: Bonding- Devoted Union) simultaneously?===\n\nSpiral Formation currently suffers from timing ambiguity. Its text will be updated to read: \"During a survival opportunity, if the survivors are standing in this formation, you may spend 1 survival to activate a weapon. This attack ignores all monster reactions. Limit, once per showdown.\" in a future Update pack. \n\nSpiral Formation and Combined Attack are both types of attacks, rather than attack modifiers. Different types of attacks cannot be used simultaneously (e.g.- Combined Attack and Charge). However, survivors may have multiple attack modifiers simultaneously affecting their attack (e.g.- Attacking with Pounce using Fist & Tooth can gain both the benefits of Monster Claw Style and an Attack Assist from Synchronized Strike).\n\nQ: What is the intended interaction between the Speaker Cult Knife and abilities like Acid Palm and Monster Claw Style? Do such abilities buff the Speaker Cult Knife because it is a \"Fist & Tooth weapon\", or are they only mean to apply specifically to the \"Fist & Tooth\" weapon survivors naturally have?.\nA: Abilities like Acid Palm and Monster Claw Style apply to all weapons with the Fist & Tooth weapon type, including the Speaker Cult Knife.\n\nQ: How can two survivors spend simultaneously in order to perform a \"Principle: Bonding- Devoted Union\" combined attack? If a combined attack draws the trap, is the full attack cancelled?.\nA: Both survivors must have an activation to spend at the time of declaring a combined attack in order to do so. This is most commonly achieved by having one survivor perform the surge survival action during the other's act. If a combined attack draws a monster's Trap, the entire combined attack is cancelled. The partners choose which survivor \"attempts to wound\" the Trap. The chosen survivor is treated as the attacker for the purposes of the Trap.\n\nQ: The Lonely Tree expansion tells you to remove the Basic Hunt event from the game after resolving the event, but the terrain card remains in the deck, so you can still randomly draw it. This allows you to fight the Lonely Tree multiple times. Is this intended?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: Can a survivor be encouraged at any time, even if not knocked down, or may only a knocked down survivor be encouraged?.\nA: Survivors can only encourage knocked down survivors unless an effect explicitly allows them to encourage in other contexts.\n\nQ: Is the Watcher intended to not give Weapon Proficiency or Hunt XP?.\nA: Yes.\n\nQ: The settlement event Heat Wave has a Lingering Effect that allows you to spend 1 endeavor to Find Fluid. The 6-7 result of this effect reads \"you may depart with heavy gear normally.\" Who is this \"you\" referring to?.\nA: The \"you\" referred to in this roll result is the survivor nominated to spend the endeavor to Find Fluid. Only that survivor may depart with heavy gear without setting their survival to 0 after applying all bonuses.\n\nQ: Should survivors find themselves in a brand new settlement with a Final Lantern, can they eventually gain another one? Do the effects of multiple Final Lanterns stack? Does the Lantern Research from their previous settlement carry over?.\nA: Yes, survivors may have multiple Final Lanterns. The effects of multiple Final Lanterns do not stack, as you cannot have multiple instances of the same survivor status. Lantern Research level is tied to your current settlement. A settlement with a Final Lantern begins at Lantern Research Level 1. Without access to Lantern Research - Pulse Discoveries, a settlement cannot increase their Lantern Research above 1.",

The wanderer's rules specify when to add the introduction to your settlement's Timeline.\n\nRules.\nWhen a wanderer joins the settlement, create a new survivor record sheet for them and increase your settlement's population.

      "term": "White Lion/Strategy",
      "definition": "The White Lion is probably the most straightforward of all the monsters you can choose to face in Kingdom Death: Monster, but that doesn't mean that it's a cake walk. \n\nHunt Events.\nThe Lion's hunt events are generally pretty positive, which means that in most cases you want to experience as many as possible. Compared to other hunts, even the negative effects are very minor. There are just a few exceptions, which will be mentioned below.\n\nThings which you may experience on a Lion Hunt:\nMinor brain damage\nMinor event damage\nAmbush\nMinor insanity\nMinor understanding\nMinor courage\nAmmonia Innovation\nLion Claw resource\nMajor additional resources\n\nGround Fighting.\nThere is a particular hunt event which can be deadly if unprepared for, which is where the Lion begins with Ground Fighting in play. To an early survivor, having to trigger ground fighting by running up and trying to wound the lion will result in significant damage being returned for not much gain.\n\nIt is for this reason that Bone Darts or Cat Gut Bow are preferred by White Lion hunters, because the lion will not react or move until a wound is scored. This means that ground fighting can effectively be nullified without damage to the survivors.\n\nThe White Lion Cub.\nThis particular hunt event allows for the survivors access to a large amount of bonus resources through killing the cub, which can be a major boost during the early game item progression. When choosing this option, just make sure that you can handle an Enraged lion, or a lion Ambush if it's close.\n\nThe Showdown.\nFor most level 1 engagements, getting in the blind spot and pummeling the lion is a pretty effective strategy, and will serve you for the first few hunts. Once you start considering fighting level 2 lions, you'll need to consider the more detailed information below.\n\nThe Lion's ability to grab and pull survivors apart can mean that you're left to spend turns chasing the lion around, missing out on precious attacks to contribute damage to the monster. Gaining the ability to dash helps to mitigate this quite effectively, as you can chase down the lion after it has grabbed someone, or alternatively dash away after an attack to prevent the grab from the Level 2+ Lion's Cunning passive. Avoid attacking from the front of the Lion to keep from being caught by its full move forward and grab reactions.\n\nThe Lion has mostly failure reactions, many of them resulting in a counter attack. For this reason, it is often better to miss with an attack than hit the Lion but fail to wound it. Eschew high speed but low strength weapons that are likely to trigger multiple return attacks.\n\nGood gear for White Lion hunters.\nThe following items have additional value during a White Lion hunt are listed below:\n\nExploits.\nThis section deals with situations which can arise which feel more mechanical, and less fluent in the game flavor. This is where you find the most variance in how players resolve the situation. Some choose to be purist and go by the rules, and others try to play by the flavor of the game and stop some situations before they get out of hand.\n\nInfinite Understanding - Showdown**.\nThis exploit requires the basic AI card Combo Claw to be in the AI deck, and to have performed a critical wound on the Lion's Strange Hand. \n\nEvery time the combo claw AI comes up, instead of attacking as it has lost its hand, an adjacent survivor gains +1 understanding.\n\nThis means that with a Cat Eye Circlet, and Rawhide Headband, you can make it much more likely, or even 100% chance to combo claw repeatedly. In this case you can just leave your survivors next to the Lion and get everyone to 10 understanding for the White Secret story event.\n\nThis can also be done with the missing jaw on Beasts Maw and Chomp\n\nThis has since been changed to a once per life time in 1.5 release",
